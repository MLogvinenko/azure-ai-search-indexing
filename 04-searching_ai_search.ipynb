    "## ‚ùó Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understand Quantitve measure of relevenace \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **NDCG@10**: This metric, standing for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10, rates a retrieval system's effectiveness in finding and correctly ordering the top 10 documents. The score ranges from 0 to 100, reflecting how closely the system's ordered list matches the ideal order of documents. NDCG@10 is widely used for its balance in evaluating both the precision of results and their proper sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NDCG@3**: Similar to NDCG@10, NDCG@3 focuses on the top 3 documents. It's particularly relevant in contexts where the highest accuracy in the topmost results is crucial, like in generative AI applications. This metric scores the system's ability to identify and correctly rank the three most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Recall@50**: This measures the proportion of high-quality documents identified within the top 50 results. It's calculated by counting the number of documents rated as high quality by a scoring prompt and dividing this by the total number of known good documents for a given query. It's a useful metric for assessing the system's ability to retrieve a broad set of relevant documents from a large pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The limitation of semantic search and embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Limitations of Embedding-Based Search\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Weakness in Keyword Precision: Embedding-based search excels in understanding the overall context and semantic meaning but may falter in accurately identifying specific keywords or phrases.It can miss documents containing exact terms if those terms are not semantically aligned with the rest of the content or query.\n",
    "    + Contextual Misinterpretation: Embeddings can sometimes overgeneralize or misinterpret the context, leading to the retrieval of documents that are broadly relevant but miss specific nuances or details. They might struggle with distinguishing subtle differences in meanings, especially in specialized or technical domains.\n",
    "    - Dependency on Training Data:The effectiveness of embeddings is highly dependent on the data they were trained on. If the training data lacks diversity or depth in certain topics, the embeddings may not capture those areas well.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Limitations of Semantic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Struggles with Synonyms and Paraphrasing:Traditional semantic search methods are often rigid in matching terms. They might not recognize synonyms or different ways of expressing the same idea, limiting their ability to retrieve all relevant documents.\n",
    "    + Limited Understanding of Context:\n",
    "    Semantic search can be effective in finding documents with specific terms but might not fully grasp the broader context or the intent behind a query. This limitation becomes pronounced in complex queries where understanding the context or the relationship between terms is crucial.\n",
    "\n"

    "## üí° Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Search as a Winner: Hybrid search combines keyword and vector search methods, capitalizing on the strengths of both. Keyword search excels in identifying specific terms, while vector search excels in understanding semantic similarities. This combination ensures a more comprehensive and accurate retrieval of documents, making it especially effective for diverse and complex search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-Ranking and L2 in Cognitive Search: The L2 layer in cognitive search improves upon the initial retrieval (L1) results by applying advanced ranking algorithms. It reorders the top documents, focusing on enhancing relevance and contextual accuracy. This is particularly important in scenarios where the initial retrieval might miss subtle nuances. L2 uses more sophisticated techniques, often leveraging deep learning models, to ensure the most relevant results are prioritized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail: The semantic ranker runs the query and documents text simultaneously though transformer models that utilize the cross-attention mechanism to produce a ranker score. The query and document chunk score is calibrated to a range that is consistent across all indexes and queries. A score of 0 represents a very irrelevant chunk, and a score of 4 represents an excellent one. In the chart below, Hybrid + Semantic ranking finds the best content for the LLM at each result set size. "

    "\n",
    "### üìä Implementation of Evaluation Metrics using Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `ndcg_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module to evaluate our search system. This function calculates the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a commonly used metric for evaluating the quality of a ranked list of items.\n",

    "true_relevance = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])  # Assuming binary relevance (1 for relevant, 0 for not relevant)\n",
    "\n",
    "# NDCG@10\n",
    "ndcg_at_10 = ndcg_score(true_relevance, predicted_scores, k=10)\n",
    "print(f\"NDCG@10: {ndcg_at_10}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# NDCG@3\n",
    "ndcg_at_3 = ndcg_score(true_relevance, predicted_scores, k=3)\n",
    "print(f\"NDCG@3: {ndcg_at_3}\")\n",

    "relevant_documents_count = np.sum(true_relevance)\n",
    "recall_at_50 = relevant_documents_count / len(true_relevance[0])  # Dividing by total documents (50 ideally)\n",
    "print(f\"Recall@50: {recall_at_50}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Evaluation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Gather Azure Cognitive Search Results**: Retrieve the search results from Azure Cognitive Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **üéØ Define Ground Truth Relevance Scores**: Establish a ground truth set of relevance scores for the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìà Calculate NDCG@3**: Use the `ndcg_score` function to calculate the NDCG at the 3rd position. This gives us a measure of the quality of the top 3 results.\n",

    "Follow these steps to create a Conda environment and set up your VSCode for running Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create Conda Environment from the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Environment File**:\n",
    "   - Ensure you have an `environment.yml` file in your repository. This file should list all the necessary libraries and dependencies for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use `make` to Create the Conda Environment**:\n",
    "   - In your terminal or command line, navigate to the repository directory and look at the Makefile.\n",
    "   - Execute the `make` command specified below to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     make create_conda_env\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This command runs a `make` target that creates a Conda environment as defined in `environment.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activating the Environment**:\n",
    "   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment by using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda activate [YourEnvName]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Replace `[YourEnvName]` with the name of your environment as specified in `environment.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Configure VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Extensions**:\n",
    "   - Download and install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions in VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attach Kernel to VSCode**:\n",
    "   - Once the Conda environment is created, you should be able to see it in the kernel selection (top right corner of your VSCode interface).\n",
    "   - Select your newly created environment as the kernel for running Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll set up a dedicated Conda environment for your project and configure VSCode to run Jupyter Notebooks efficiently. This environment will contain all the necessary dependencies in your `environment.yml` file.\n",
