       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are becoming a crucial building block in developing powerful agents\\nthat utilize LLMs for reasoning, tool usage, and adapting to new observations (Yao et al., 2022; Xi\\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks. Given the expanding tasks that could\\nbenefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of\\nagents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help\\nencourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023),\\nand provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is\\nintriguing to ask the following question: how can we facilitate the development of LLM applications\\nthat could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?\\nOur insight is to use multi-agent conversations to achieve it. There are at least three reasons con-\\nfirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat-\\noptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate\\nthrough conversations with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea-\\nsoning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad\\nrange of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings),\\nconversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities\\nin a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex\\ntasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this\\npartitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and\\nsupport different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten-\\ntially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent\\nconversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil-\\nity to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions:\\n(1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in\\nmulti-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can\\naccommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying\\ncomplexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different\\nconversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and\\nstatic vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent\\ninteractions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would\\nlimit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.\\nWhile there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a\\ngeneralized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts.\\n1Customizable and conversable agents. AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-\\nage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can\\neasily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code,\\nwire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in\\ncapabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors.\\nTo make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made conversable –\\nthey can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold\\nmultiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer-\\ntain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the\\nstrong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat\\nand also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1)\\n2Conversation programming. A fundamental insight of AutoGen is to simplify and unify com-\\nplex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So AutoGen adopts a program-\\nming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as\\nconversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two\\nprimary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as\\ndescribed above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-\\ncentric computation andcontrol . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-\\ngramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent\\nbehaviors. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and\\nexperimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)\\n3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents\\nand conversation programming. These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support\\napplications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities. Moreover, we perform both\\nevaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications. The results show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,\\nwhile reducing development effort. (Section 3 and Appendix D)\\n2 The AutoGen Framework\\nTo reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-\\nmains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows\\nusing multi-agent conversations. This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-\\nmented agents. This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and\\nconversation programming.\\n2.1 Conversable Agents\\nInAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and\\nreceive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation. It\\nmaintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess\\na set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc. The agents can act according\\nto programmed behavior patterns described next.\\nAgent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools. Since an agent’s capabilities directly\\ninfluence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents\\nwith various capabilities. AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,\\nincluding 1) LLMs. LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role\\nplaying, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing\\nfeedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways\\nvia novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. AutoGen also offers\\nenhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,\\nvia an enhanced LLM inference layer. 2) Humans. Human involvement is desired or even essential\\nin many LLM applications. AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-\\nbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on\\nthe agent configuration. The default user proxy agent allows configurable human involvement levels\\nand patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for\\nhumans to skip providing input. 3) Tools. Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools\\nvia code execution or function execution. For example, the default user proxy agent in AutoGen is\\nable to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls.\\nAgent customization and cooperation. Based on application-specific needs, each agent can be\\nconfigured to have a mix of basic back-end types to display complex behavior in multi-agent con-\\nversations. AutoGen allows easy creation of agents with specialized capabilities and roles by reusing\\nor extending the built-in agents. The yellow-shaded area of Figure 2 provides a sketch of the built-in\\nagents in AutoGen . The ConversableAgent class is the highest-level agent abstraction and, by\\ndefault, can use LLMs, humans, and tools. The AssistantAgent andUserProxyAgent are two\\npre-configured ConversableAgent subclasses, each representing a common usage mode, i.e., act-\\ning as an AI assistant (backed by LLMs) and acting as a human proxy to solicit human input or\\nexecute code/function calls (backed by humans and/or tools).\\nIn the example on the right-hand side of Figure 1, an LLM-backed assistant agent and a tool- and\\nhuman-backed user proxy agent are deployed together to tackle a task. Here, the assistant agent\\ngenerates a solution with the help of LLMs and passes the solution to the user proxy agent. Then,\\nthe user proxy agent solicits human inputs or executes the assistant’s code and passes the results as\\nfeedback back to the assistant.\\n4Appendix C presents an example of such novel prompting techniques which empowers the default LLM-\\nbacked assistant agent in AutoGen to converse with other agents in multi-step problem solving.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The top sub-\\nfigure illustrates the built-in agents provided by AutoGen , which have unified conversation interfaces\\nand can be customized. The middle sub-figure shows an example of using AutoGen to develop\\na two-agent system with a custom reply function. The bottom sub-figure illustrates the resulting\\nautomated agent chat from the two-agent system during program execution.\\nBy allowing custom agents that can converse with each other, conversable agents in AutoGen serve\\nas a useful building block. However, to develop applications where agents make meaningful progress\\non tasks, developers also need to be able to specify and mold these multi-agent conversations.\\n2.2 Conversation Programming\\nAs a solution to the above problem, AutoGen utilizes conversation programming , a paradigm that\\nconsiders two concepts: the first is computation – the actions agents take to compute their response\\nin a multi-agent conversation. And the second is control flow – the sequence (or conditions) un-\\nder which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to\\nprogram these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In AutoGen , these\\ncomputations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is\\ninvolved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina-\\ntion condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’\\ndecisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the\\ninter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow\\nas agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.\\nFigure 2 provides a simple illustration. The bottom sub-figure shows how individual agents perform\\ntheir role-specific, conversation-centric computations to generate responses (e.g., via LLM inference\\ncalls and code execution). The task progresses through conversations displayed in the dialog box.\\nThe middle sub-figure demonstrates a conversation-based control flow. When the assistant receives\\na message, the user proxy agent typically sends the human input as a reply. If there is no input, it\\nexecutes any code in the assistant’s message instead.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen features the following design patterns to facilitate conversation programming:\\n1.Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat. Agents in\\nAutoGen have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation-\\ncentric computation, including a send/receive function for sending/receiving messages and a\\ngenerate reply function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received\\nmessage. AutoGen also introduces and by default adopts an agent auto-reply mechanism to\\nrealize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au-\\ntomatically invokes generate reply and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination\\ncondition is satisfied. AutoGen provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code\\nor function execution, or human input. One can also register custom reply functions to customize\\nthe behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender\\nagent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is\\ninitialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds\\nnaturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation\\nflow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”)\\nof Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation\\nwould proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Pro-\\ngram Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and\\nunified way to define the workflow.\\n2.Control by fusion of programming and natural language. AutoGen allows the usage of\\nprogramming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1) Natural-\\nlanguage control via LLMs. InAutoGen , one can control the conversation flow by prompting\\nthe LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the\\nbuilt-in AssistantAgent inAutoGen uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors\\nand generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent\\nto confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to\\nconsume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are\\ncompleted to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can\\nbe found in Appendix C. 2) Programming-language control. InAutoGen , Python code can be\\nused to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the\\nmax number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control\\nthe conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “Conversation-\\nDriven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3) Control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. AutoGen also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM\\ninference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from nat-\\nural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).\\nIn the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse\\npatterns. In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, AutoGen also supports dynamic\\nconversation flows with multiple agents. AutoGen provides two general ways to achieve this: 1)\\nCustomized generate reply function: within the customized generate reply function, one\\nagent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending\\non the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides\\nwhether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging\\nadditional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In\\naddition, AutoGen supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in GroupChatManager ,\\nwhich can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We\\nelaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems\\nto showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.\\n3 Applications of AutoGen\\nWe demonstrate six applications using AutoGen (see Figure 3) to illustrate its potential in simplify-\\ning the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected\\nbased on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-\\nities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6). Together, these\\ncriteria showcase AutoGen ’s role in advancing the LLM-application landscape.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,\\nincluding open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-\\nAct (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and\\nChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize\\nthe results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and\\non the entire5test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-\\nready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including\\nthe commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process\\nwith the help of AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one only needs to set\\nhuman input mode=‘ALWAYS’ in the UserProxyAgent of the system in scenario 1. We demon-\\nstrate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that\\ncannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where\\nmultiple human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our\\nexperiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or\\nnew experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of\\nthe evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.\\nA2: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\\nRetrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic\\nlimitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this section, we employ AutoGen to\\nbuild a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system (Lewis et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2021)\\nnamed Retrieval-augmented Chat. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User\\nProxy agent and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, both of which are extended from built-in\\nagents from AutoGen . The Retrieval-augmented User Proxy includes a vector database (Chroma,\\n5We did not evaluate ChatGPT on the whole dataset since it requires substantial manual effort and is re-\\nstricted by its hourly message-number limitation.

A detailed\\nworkflow description of the Retrieval-augmented Chat is provided in Appendix D.\\nWe evaluate Retrieval-augmented Chat in both question-answering and code-generation scenarios.\\n(Scenario 1 ) We first perform an evaluation regarding natural question answering on the Natural\\nQuestions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and report results in Figure 4b. In this evaluation, we\\ncompare our system with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) following an existing evaluation6prac-\\ntice (Adlakha et al., 2023). Leveraging the conversational design and natural-language control,\\nAutoGen introduces a novel interactive retrieval feature in this application: whenever the retrieved\\ncontext does not contain the information, instead of terminating, the LLM-based assistant would\\nreply “ Sorry, I cannot find any information about... UPDATE CONTEXT. ” which will invoke more\\nretrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say “I\\ndon’t know” instead of “UPDATE CONTEXT. ” in cases where relevant information is not found,\\nand report results in Figure 4b. The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed\\nplays a non-trivial role in the process. We give a concrete example and results using this appealing\\nfeature in Appendix D. ( Scenario 2 ) We further demonstrate how Retrieval-augmented Chat aids in\\ngenerating code based on a given codebase that contains code not included in GPT-4’s training data.\\nEvaluation and demonstration details for both scenarios are included in Appendix D.\\n6The results of DPR with GPT-3.5 shown in Figure 4b are from (Adlakha et al., 2023).

       " Document(page_content='A3: Decision Making in Text World Environments\\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate how AutoGen can be used to develop effective applications that\\ninvolve interactive or online decision making. We perform the study using the ALFWorld (Shridhar\\net al., 2021) benchmark, which includes a diverse collection of synthetic language-based interactive\\ndecision-making tasks in household environments.\\nWith AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld. It consists of\\nan LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor\\nagent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates Re-\\nAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge\\nencountered in both ReAct and the AutoGen -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to\\nleverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the\\nsystem getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of AutoGen\\nallows us to address this issue effectively: With AutoGen , we are able to introduce a grounding\\nagent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as “You must find and take the object\\nbefore you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it. ” –whenever\\nthe system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to\\navoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants\\nof our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct7on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report\\nresults in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15%\\nperformance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding\\nagent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly miti-\\ngated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error\\nloops. For an example trajectory comparing the systems see Appendix D, Figure 10.\\nA4: Multi-Agent Coding\\nIn this subsection, we use AutoGen to build a multi-agent coding system based on OptiGuide (Li\\net al., 2023a), a system that excels at writing code to interpret optimization solutions and answer\\nuser questions, such as exploring the implications of changing a supply-chain decision or under-\\nstanding why the optimizer made a particular choice. The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the\\nAutoGen -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as\\n“What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2? ” to the Commander agent. The Com-\\nmander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer\\nthe question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the\\ncode, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will\\nuse external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution\\nresults. For instance, the writer may say “ if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the\\ntotal cost would increase by 10.5%. ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the\\nend user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the\\nCommander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information. The process might\\nbe repeated multiple times until the user’s question is answered or timed-out.\\nWith AutoGen the core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. We provide a detailed comparison of user expe-\\nrience with ChatGPT+Code Interpreter and AutoGen -based OptiGuide in Appendix D, where we\\nshow that AutoGen -based OptiGuide could save around 3x of user’s time and reduce user interac-\\ntions by 3 - 5 times on average. We also conduct an ablation showing that multi-agent abstraction is\\nnecessary. Specifically, we construct a single-agent approach where a single agent conducts both the\\ncode-writing and safeguard processes. We tested the single- and multi-agent approaches on a dataset\\nof 100 coding tasks, which is crafted to include equal numbers of safe and unsafe tasks. Evaluation\\nresults as reported in Figure 4d show that the multi-agent design boosts the F-1 score in identifying\\nunsafe code by 8% (with GPT-4) and 35% (with GPT-3.5-turbo).\\n7Results of ReAct are obtained by directly running its official code with default settings. The code uses\\ntext-davinci-003 as backend LM and does not support GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A5: Dynamic Group Chat\\nAutoGen provides native support for a dynamic group chat communication pattern, in which par-\\nticipating agents share the same context and converse with the others in a dynamic manner instead\\nof following a pre-defined order. Dynamic group chat relies on ongoing conversations to guide the\\nflow of interaction among agents. These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where col-\\nlaboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In AutoGen , the GroupChatManager\\nclass serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps:\\ndynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting\\nthe message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style\\nprompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared\\nto a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effec-\\ntive consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and\\nspeaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls.\\nWe include detailed results in Appendix D.\\nA6: Conversational Chess\\nUsing AutoGen , we developed Conversational Chess, a natural language interface game shown in\\nthe last sub-figure of Figure 3. It features built-in agents for players, which can be human or LLM,\\nand a third-party board agent to provide information and validate moves based on standard rules.\\nWith AutoGen , we enabled two essential features: (1) Natural, flexible, and engaging game dynam-\\nics, enabled by the customizable agent design in AutoGen . Conversational Chess supports a range\\nof game-play patterns, including AI-AI, AI-human, and human-human, with seamless switching\\nbetween these modes during a single game. An illustrative example of these entertaining game dy-\\nnamics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain\\ngame integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move\\nis invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move\\nbefore continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con-\\nsistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied\\non a relevant prompt “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves” to\\nground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused\\ngame disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board\\nagent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants. A comprehensive demon-\\nstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D.\\n4 Discussion\\nWe introduced an open-source library, AutoGen , that incorporates the paradigms of conversable\\nagents and conversation programming. This library utilizes capable agents that are well-suited for\\nmulti-agent cooperation. It features a unified conversation interface among the agents, along with\\nan auto-reply mechanisms, which help establish an agent-interaction interface that capitalizes on the\\nstrengths of chat-optimized LLMs with broad capabilities while accommodating a wide range of\\napplications. AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating and experimenting with multi-\\nagent systems that can easily fulfill various practical requirements, such as reusing, customizing,\\nand extending existing agents, as well as programming conversations between them.\\nOur experiments, as detailed in Section 3, demonstrate that this approach offers numerous benefits.\\nThe adoption of AutoGen has resulted in improved performance (over state-of-the-art approaches),\\nreduced development code, and decreased manual burden for existing applications. It offers flex-\\nibility to developers, as demonstrated in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, where AutoGen enables\\nmulti-agent chats to follow a dynamic pattern rather than fixed back-and-forth interactions. It allows\\nhumans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner. Despite the\\ncomplexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent\\ncooperation), the implementation based on AutoGen remains straightforward. Dividing tasks among\\nseparate agents promotes modularity. Furthermore, since each agent can be developed, tested, and\\nmaintained separately, this approach simplifies overall development and code management.\\n9', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although this work is still in its early experimental stages, it paves the way for numerous future\\ndirections and research opportunities. For instance, we can explore effective integration of existing\\nagent implementations into our multi-agent framework and investigate the optimal balance between\\nautomation and human control in multi-agent workflows. As we further develop and refine AutoGen ,\\nwe aim to investigate which strategies, such as agent topology and conversation patterns, lead to the\\nmost effective multi-agent conversations while optimizing the overall efficiency, among other fac-\\ntors. While increasing the number of agents and other degrees of freedom presents opportunities for\\ntackling more complex problems, it may also introduce new safety challenges that require additional\\nstudies and careful consideration.\\nWe provide more discussion in Appendix B, including guidelines for using AutoGen and direction\\nof future work. We hope AutoGen will help improve many LLM applications in terms of speed of\\ndevelopment, ease of experimentation, and overall effectiveness and safety. We actively welcome\\ncontributions from the broader community.\\nEthics statement\\nThere are several potential ethical considerations that could arise from the development and use of\\ntheAutoGen framework.\\n• Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations\\nbetween agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that\\ndevelopers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy.\\n• Bias and Fairness: LLMs have been shown to exhibit biases present in their training data (Navigli\\net al., 2023). When using LLMs in the AutoGen framework, it is crucial to address and mitigate\\nany biases that may arise in the conversations between agents. Developers should be aware of\\npotential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity.\\n• Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in-\\nvolves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability\\nand transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making\\nprocess of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues\\nor biases.\\n• Trust and Reliance: AutoGen leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing\\nautomation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this\\ninteraction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user\\neducation about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019).\\n• Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa-\\ntion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. In particular, allowing LLM agents to\\nmake changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing\\npackages, could be risky. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that\\nappropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work presented in this report was made possible through discussions and feedback from Peter\\nLee, Johannes Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Steven Lucco, Umesh Madan, Robin Moeur, Piali Choud-\\nhury, Saleema Amershi, Adam Fourney, Victor Dibia, Guoqing Zheng, Corby Rosset, Ricky Loynd,\\nEce Kamar, Rafah Hosn, John Langford, Ida Momennejad, Brian Krabach, Taylor Webb, Shanka\\nSubhra Mondal, Wei-ge Chen, Robert Gruen, Yinan Li, Yue Wang, Suman Nath, Tanakorn Leesat-\\napornwongsa, Xin Wang, Shishir Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Saehan Jo, Ishai Menache, Kontantina Mel-\\nlou, Runlong Zhou, Feiran Jia, Hamed Khanpour, Hamid Palangi, Srinagesh Sharma, Julio Albinati\\nCortez, Amin Saied, Yuzhe Ma, Dujian Ding, Linyong Nan, Prateek Yadav, Shannon Shen, Ankur\\nMallick, Mark Encarnaci ´on, Lars Liden, Tianwei Yue, Julia Kiseleva, Anastasia Razdaibiedina, and\\nLuciano Del Corro.

       " Document(page_content='A Related Work\\nWe examine existing LLM-based agent systems or frameworks that can be used to build LLM appli-\\ncations. We categorize the related work into single-agent and multi-agent systems and specifically\\nprovide a summary of differentiators comparing AutoGen with existing multi-agent systems in Ta-\\nble 1. Note that many of these systems are evolving open-source projects, so the remarks and\\nstatements about them may only be accurate as of the time of writing. We refer interested readers to\\ndetailed LLM-based agent surveys (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b)\\nSingle-Agent Systems:\\n•AutoGPT : AutoGPT is an open-source implementation of an AI agent that attempts to au-\\ntonomously achieve a given goal (AutoGPT, 2023). It follows a single-agent paradigm in which\\nit augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration.\\n•ChatGPT+ (with code interpreter or plugin) : ChatGPT, a conversational AI service or agent,\\ncan now be used alongside a code interpreter or plugin (currently available only under the pre-\\nmium subscription plan ChatGPT Plus) (OpenAI, 2023). The code interpreter enables ChatGPT\\nto execute code, while the plugin enhances ChatGPT with a wide range of curated tools.\\n•LangChain Agents : LangChain is a general framework for developing LLM-based applica-\\ntions (LangChain, 2023). LangChain Agents is a subpackage for using an LLM to choose a\\nsequence of actions. There are various types of agents in LangChain Agents, with the ReAct agent\\nbeing a notable example that combines reasoning and acting when using LLMs (mainly designed\\nfor LLMs prior to ChatGPT) (Yao et al., 2022). All agents provided in LangChain Agents fol-\\nlow a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative\\nmodes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these lim-\\nitations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not\\nbased on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain\\nlies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped\\nby LangChain and the corresponding interface.\\n•Transformers Agent : Transformers Agent (HuggingFace, 2023) is an experimental natural-\\nlanguage API built on the transformers repository. It includes a set of curated tools and an agent\\nto interpret natural language and use these tools. Similar to AutoGPT, it follows a single-agent\\nparadigm and does not support agent collaboration.\\nAutoGen differs from the single-agent systems above by supporting multi-agent LLM applications.\\nMulti-Agent Systems:\\n•BabyAGI : BabyAGI (BabyAGI, 2023) is an example implementation of an AI-powered task man-\\nagement system in a Python script. In this implemented system, multiple LLM-based agents\\nare used. For example, there is an agent for creating new tasks based on the objective and the\\nresult of the previous task, an agent for prioritizing the task list, and an agent for completing\\ntasks/sub-tasks. As a multi-agent system, BabyAGI adopts a static agent conversation pattern,\\ni.e., a predefined order of agent communication, while AutoGen supports both static and dynamic\\nconversation patterns and additionally supports tool usage and human involvement.\\n•CAMEL : CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b) is a communicative agent framework. It demonstrates\\nhow role playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task comple-\\ntion. It also records agent conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. An\\nInception-prompting technique is used to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. Un-\\nlikeAutoGen , CAMEL does not natively support tool usage, such as code execution. Although it\\nis proposed as an infrastructure for multi-agent conversation, it only supports static conversation\\npatterns, while AutoGen additionally supports dynamic conversation patterns.\\n•Multi-Agent Debate: Two recent works investigate and show that multi-agent debate is an effec-\\ntive way to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs (Liang et al., 2023) and to improve the factuality\\nand reasoning of LLMs (Du et al., 2023). In both works, multiple LLM inference instances are\\nconstructed as multiple agents to solve problems with agent debate. Each agent is simply an LLM\\ninference instance, while no tool or human is involved, and the inter-agent conversation needs\\nto follow a pre-defined order. These works attempt to build LLM applications with multi-agent\\nconversation, while AutoGen , designed as a generic infrastructure, can be used to facilitate this\\ndevelopment and enable more applications with dynamic conversation patterns.\\n14', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='•MetaGPT : MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023) is a specialized LLM application based on a multi-agent\\nconversation framework for automatic software development. They assign different roles to GPTs\\nto collaboratively develop software. They differ from AutoGen by being specialized solutions to\\na certain scenario, while AutoGen is a generic infrastructure to facilitate building applications for\\nvarious scenarios.\\nThere are a few other specialized single-agent or multi-agent systems, such as V oyager (Wang et al.,\\n2023a) and Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), which we skip due to lower relevance.

       " Document(page_content='B Expanded Discussion\\nThe applications in Section 3 show how AutoGen not only enables new applications but also helps\\nrenovate existing ones. For example, in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, AutoGen enabled the cre-\\nation of multi-agent conversations that follow a dynamic pattern instead of a fixed back-and-forth.\\nAnd in both A5 and A6, humans can participate in the activities together with multiple other AI\\nagents in a conversational manner. Similarly, A1-A4 show how popular applications can be reno-\\nvated quickly with AutoGen . Despite the complexity of these applications (most of them involve\\nmore than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent cooperation), our AutoGen -based implementa-\\ntion remains simple, demonstrating promising opportunities to build creative applications and a large\\nspace for innovation. In reflecting on why these benefits can be achieved in these applications with\\nAutoGen , we believe there are a few reasons:\\n•Ease of use : The built-in agents can be used out-of-the-box, delivering strong performance even\\nwithout any customization. (A1, A3)\\n•Modularity : The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each\\nagent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall develop-\\nment process and facilitating code management. (A3, A4, A5, and A6)\\n•Programmability: AutoGen allows users to extend/customize existing agents to develop systems\\nsatisfying their specific needs with ease. (A1-A6). For example, with AutoGen , the core workflow\\ncode in A4 is reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines, for a 4x saving.\\n•Allowing human involvement :AutoGen provides a native mechanism to achieve human partici-\\npation and/or human oversight. With AutoGen , humans can seamlessly and optionally cooperate\\nwith AIs to solve problems or generally participate in the activity. AutoGen also facilitates inter-\\nactive user instructions to ensure the process stays on the desired path. (A1, A2, A5, and A6)\\n•Collaborative/adversarial agent interactions : Like many collaborative agent systems (Dong\\net al., 2023), agents in AutoGen can share information and knowledge, to complement each other’s\\nabilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. (A1, A2, A3, and A4). Analogously, in certain\\nscenarios, some agents are required to work in an adversarial way. Relevant information is shared\\namong different conversations in a controlled manner, preventing distraction or hallucination. (A4,\\nA6). AutoGen supports both patterns, enabling effective utilization and augmentation of LLMs.\\nB.1 General Guidelines for Using AutoGen\\nBelow we give some recommendations for using agents in AutoGen to accomplish a task.\\n1.Consider using built-in agents first. For example, AssistantAgent is pre-configured to be\\nbacked by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via\\ncode. The UserProxyAgent is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution.\\nMany problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents\\nfor an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition,\\ncode execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an\\nagent; (2) AutoGen supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective\\nway to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3) UserProxyAgent\\ncan be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys-\\ntem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its\\nconversation flow with natural language.\\n2.Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat\\nsetup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can\\nbe easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a\\ndynamic way.\\n3. Try to reuse built-in reply methods based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a\\ncustom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way\\n(e.g., the built-in agent GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply\\nfunction when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3).\\n4. When developing a new application with UserProxyAgent ,start with humans always in\\nthe loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au-\\ntonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis-\\ncovering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting\\n16', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='human input mode = ‘NEVER’. This enables LLM as a backend, and one can either use the\\nLLM or manually generate diverse system messages to simulate different use cases.\\n5. Despite the numerous advantages of AutoGen agents, there could be cases/scenarios where other\\nlibraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements\\nfor back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and-\\nforth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023),\\nLlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023),\\nGorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM\\ninference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are\\nhelpful, one can use them as tool backends for AutoGen agents. For example, one can readily use\\ntools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in AutoGen agent. (3) For specific applications, one\\nmay want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could\\nwrap those agents as conversable agents in AutoGen and then use them to build LLM applications\\nthrough multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among\\nmany tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages\\nlike ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with AutoGen to automate such tuning.\\nB.2 Future Work\\nThis work raises many research questions and future directions and .\\nDesigning optimal multi-agent workflows: Creating a multi-agent workflow for a given task can\\ninvolve many decisions, e.g., how many agents to include, how to assign agent roles and agent\\ncapabilities, how the agents should interact with each other, and whether to automate a particular\\npart of the workflow. There may not exist a one-fits-all answer, and the best solution might depend\\non the specific application. This raises important questions: For what types of tasks and applications\\nare multi-agent workflows most useful? How do multiple agents help in different applications? For\\na given task, what is the optimal (e.g., cost-effective) multi-agent workflow?\\nCreating highly capable agents: AutoGen can enable the development of highly capable agents\\nthat leverage the strengths of LLMs, tools, and humans. Creating such agents is crucial to ensuring\\nthat a multi-agent workflow can effectively troubleshoot and make progress on a task. For example,\\nwe observed that CAMEL, another multi-agent LLM system, cannot effectively solve problems in\\nmost cases primarily because it lacks the capability to execute tools or code. This failure shows that\\nLLMs and multi-agent conversations with simple role playing are insufficient, and highly capable\\nagents with diverse skill sets are essential. We believe that more systematic work will be required to\\ndevelop guidelines for application-specific agents, to create a large OSS knowledge base of agents,\\nand to create agents that can discover and upgrade their skills (Cai et al., 2023).\\nEnabling scale, safety, and human agency: Section 3 shows how complex multi-agent workflows\\ncan enable new applications, and future work will be needed to assess whether scaling further can\\nhelp solve extremely complex tasks. However, as these workflows scale and grow more complex,\\nit may become difficult to log and adjust them. Thus, it will become essential to develop clear\\nmechanisms and tools to track and debug their behavior. Otherwise, these techniques risk resulting\\nin incomprehensible, unintelligible chatter among agents (Lewis et al., 2017).\\nOur work also shows how complex, fully autonomous workflows with AutoGen can be useful, but\\nfully autonomous agent conversations will need to be used with care. While the autonomous mode\\nAutoGen supports could be desirable in many scenarios, a high level of autonomy can also pose\\npotential risks, especially in high-risk applications (Amodei et al., 2016; Weld & Etzioni, 1994). As\\na result, building fail-safes against cascading failures and exploitation, mitigating reward hacking,\\nout of control and undesired behaviors, maintaining effective human oversight of applications built\\nwith AutoGen agents will become important. While AutoGen provides convenient and seamless\\ninvolvement of humans through a user proxy agent, developers and stakeholders still need to under-\\nstand and determine the appropriate level and pattern of human involvement to ensure the safe and\\nethical use of the technology (Horvitz, 1999; Amershi et al., 2019).\\n17', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='problem involves solving a number theory issue. The correctness counts and reasons for failure\\nare detailed in Table 2. For the quantitative evaluation, we conduct two sets of experiments on\\nthe MATH dataset to assess the correctness of these systems: (1) an experiment involving 120\\nlevel-5 (the most challenging level) problems, including 20 problems from six categories, excluding\\ngeometry, and (2) an experiment on the entire test set, which includes 5000 problems. We exclude\\nAutoGPT from this evaluation as it cannot access results from code executions and does not solve\\nany problems in the qualitative evaluation. Our analysis of the entire dataset reveals that AutoGen\\nachieves an overall accuracy of 69.48%, while GPT-4’s accuracy stands at 55.18%. From these\\nevaluations, we have the following observations regarding the problem-solving success rate and\\nuser experience of these systems:\\n• Problem-solving success rate: Results from the quantitative evaluations show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve the highest problem-solving success rate among all the compared methods. The qual-\\nitative evaluations elucidate common failure reasons across several alternative approaches. Chat-\\nGPT+Code Interpreter fails to solve the second problem, and ChatGPT+Plugin struggles to solve\\nboth problems. AutoGPT fails on both problems due to code execution issues. The LangChain\\nagent also fails on both problems, producing code that results in incorrect answers in all trials.\\n• Based on the qualitative evaluation, we analyze the user experience concerning the verbosity of\\nthe response and the ability of the LLM-based system to run without unexpected behaviors. Chat-\\nGPT+Plugin is the least verbose, mainly because Wolfram queries are much shorter than Python\\ncode. AutoGen , ChatGPT+Code Interpreter, and LangChain exhibit similar verbosity, although\\nLangChain is slightly more verbose due to more code execution errors. AutoGPT is the most\\nverbose system owing to predefined steps like THOUGHTS, REASONING, and PLAN, which it\\nincludes in replies every time. Overall, AutoGen and ChatGPT+Code Interpreter operate smoothly\\nwithout exceptions. We note the occurrences of undesired behaviors from other LLM-based sys-\\ntems that could affect user experience: AutoGPT consistently outputs code without the print’\\nstatement and cannot correct this, requiring the user to run them manually; ChatGPT with Wol-\\nfram Alpha plugin has the potential to become stuck in a loop that must be manually stopped; and\\nLangchain ReAct could exit with a parse error, necessitating the passing of a ‘handle parse error’\\nparameter.\\nEnable Multi-User Problem Solving ViaStudent        and Expert Student Proxy\\nStudentAssistant\\nExpertAssistant\\nExpert Proxy\\nAsk for expert\\nEnable Autonomous and Human-in-the-loop Problem Solving\\nFigure 6: Examples of three settings utilized to solve math problems using AutoGen : (Gray) En-\\nables a workflow where a student collaborates with an assistant agent to solve problems, either\\nautonomously or in a human-in-the-loop mode.

       " Document(page_content='helpful. To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one can set human input mode=‘ALWAYS’\\nin the user proxy agent. We select one challenging problem that none of these systems can solve\\nautonomously across three trials. We adhere to the process outlined below to provide human inputs\\nfor all the compared methods:\\n1. Input the problem: Find the equation of the plane which bisects the angle\\nbetween the planes 3x−6y+ 2z+ 5 = 0 and4x−12y+ 3z−3 = 0 ,and which\\ncontains the point (−5,−1,−5).Enter your answer in the form\\nAx+By+Cz+D= 0,\\nwhere A, B, C, D are integers such that A > 0and\\ngcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.\\n2. The response from the system does not solve the problem correctly. We then give a\\nhint to the model: Your idea is not correct. Let’s solve this together.\\nSuppose P= (x, y, z )is a point that lies on a plane that bisects the\\nangle, the distance from P to the two planes is the same. Please\\nset up this equation first.\\n3. We expect the system to give the correct distance equation. Since the equation involves\\nan absolute sign that is hard to solve, we would give the next hint: Consider the two\\ncases to remove the abs sign and get two possible solutions.\\n4. If the system returns the two possible solutions and doesn’t continue to the next step, we\\ngive the last hint: Use point (-5,-1,-5) to determine which is correct and\\ngive the final answer.\\n5. Final answer is 11x+6y+5z+86=0 .\\nWe observed that AutoGen consistently solved the problem across all three trials. ChatGPT+Code\\nInterpreter and ChatGPT+Plugin managed to solve the problem in two out of three trials, while Au-\\ntoGPT failed to solve it in all three attempts. In its unsuccessful attempt, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nfailed to adhere to human hints. In its failed trial, ChatGPT+Plugin produced an almost correct solu-\\ntion but had a sign discrepancy in the final answer. AutoGPT was unable to yield a correct solution\\nin any of the trials. In one trial, it derived an incorrect distance equation. In the other two trials, the\\nfinal answer was incorrect due to code execution errors.\\nScenario 3: Multi-User Problem Solving. Next-generation LLM applications may necessitate\\nthe involvement of multiple real users for collectively solving a problem with the assistance of\\nLLMs. We showcase how AutoGen can be leveraged to effortlessly construct such a system. Specif-\\nically, building upon scenario 2 mentioned above, we aim to devise a simple system involving two\\nhuman users: a student and an expert. In this setup, the student interacts with an LLM assistant to\\naddress some problems, and the LLM automatically resorts to the expert when necessary.\\nThe overall workflow is as follows: The student chats with the LLM-based assistant agent through\\na student proxy agent to solve problems. When the assistant cannot solve the problem satisfactorily,\\nor the solution does not match the expectation of the student, it would automatically hold the con-\\nversation and call the pre-defined askforexpert function via the function callfeature of GPT\\nin order to resort to the expert. Specifically, it would automatically produce the initial message for\\ntheaskforexpert function, which could be the statement of the problem or the request to verify\\nthe solution to a problem, and the expert is supposed to respond to this message with the help of\\nthe expert assistant. After the conversation between the expert and the expert’s assistant, the final\\nmessage would be sent back to the student assistant as the response to the initial message. Then, the\\nstudent assistant would resume the conversation with the student using the response from the expert\\nfor a better solution. A detailed visualization is shown in Figure 6.\\nWith AutoGen , constructing the student/expert proxy agent and the assistant agents is straight-\\nforward by reusing the built-in UserProxyAgent andAssistantAgent through appropriate\\nconfigurations. The only development required involves writing several lines of code for the\\naskforexpert function, which then becomes part of the configuration for the assistant. Ad-\\nditionally, it’s easy to extend such a system to include more than one expert, with a specific\\naskforexpert function for each, or to include multiple student users with a shared expert for\\nconsultation.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Satisfied Answers or `Update Context`\\nFigure 7: Overview of Retrieval-augmented Chat which involves two agents, including a Retrieval-\\naugmented User Proxy and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Given a set of documents, the\\nRetrieval-augmented User Proxy first automatically processes documents—splits, chunks, and stores\\nthem in a vector database. Then for a given user input, it retrieves relevant chunks as context and\\nsends it to the Retrieval-augmented Assistant, which uses LLM to generate code or text to answer\\nquestions. Agents converse until they find a satisfactory answer.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow of Retrieval-Augmented Chat is illustrated in Figure 7. To\\nuse Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\\n1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding simi-\\nlarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based\\non the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it\\nis instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\\n3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and\\nsends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it\\nterminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along\\nwith the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation\\nis enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n4. If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar\\nchunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it\\ngenerates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate\\nan answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times.\\nThe conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.\\nWe utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat in two scenarios. The first scenario aids in generating code\\nbased on a given codebase. While LLMs possess strong coding abilities, they are unable to utilize\\npackages or APIs that are not included in their training data, e.g., private codebases, or have trouble\\nusing trained ones that are frequently updated post-training. Hence, Retrieval-Augmented Code\\nGeneration is considered to be highly valuable. The second scenario involves question-answering\\non the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), enabling us to obtain comparative\\nevaluation metrics for the performance of our system.\\nScenario 1: Evaluation on Natural Questions QA dataset. In this case, we evaluate the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Chat’s end-to-end question-answering performance using the Natural Ques-\\ntions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). We collected 5,332 non-redundant context documents and\\n6,775 queries from HuggingFace. First, we create a document collection based on the entire context\\ncorpus and store it in the vector database. Then, we utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat to answer the\\nquestions.

The F1 score and Recall for the\\nfirst 500 questions are 23.40% and 62.60%, respectively, aligning closely with the results reported\\nin Figure 4b. Consequently, we assert that AutoGen W/O interactive retrieval outperforms DPR due\\nto differences in the retrievers employed. Specifically, we utilize a straightforward vector search\\nretriever with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for embeddings.\\nFurthermore, we analyze the number of LLM calls in experiments involving both AutoGen and\\nAutoGen W/O interactive retrieval , revealing that approximately 19.4% of questions in the Natural\\nQuestions dataset trigger an “Update Context” operation, resulting in additional LLM calls.\\nScenario 2: Code Generation Leveraging Latest APIs from the Codebase.

Consequently, the original GPT-4 model is unable to generate the\\ncorrect code, due to its lack of knowledge regarding Spark-related APIs. Instead, it erroneously cre-\\nates a non-existent parameter, spark , and sets it to True’. Nevertheless, with Retrieval-Augmented\\nChat, we provide the latest reference documents as context. Then, GPT-4 generates the correct code\\nblocks by setting usespark andforce cancel to True’.\\n23', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

We propose two designs: a two-agent design where the assistant\\nagent suggests the next step, and the Executor executes actions and provides feedback. The three-\\nagent design adds a grounding agent that supplies commonsense facts to the executor when needed.\\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a synthetic language-based interactive decision-making task.\\nIt comprises textual environments that aim to simulate real-world household scenes. Given a high-\\nlevel goal (e.g., putting a hot apple in the fridge) and the description of the household environment,\\nthe agent needs to explore and interact with the simulated household environment through a textual\\ninterface. A typical task environment contains various types of locations and could require more\\nthan 40 steps to finish, which highlights the need for agents to decompose the goal into subtasks and\\ntackle them one by one, while effectively exploring the environments.\\nDetailed Workflow. We first propose a straightforward two-agent system with AutoGen , illustrated\\non the left-hand side of Figure 9, to tackle tasks from this benchmark. The system consists of\\nan assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant agent generates plans and makes action\\ndecisions to solve the tasks. The executor agent is tailored specifically for ALFWorld. It performs\\nactions proposed by the assistant and reports action execution results in the household environment\\nas feedback to the assistant. Due to the strict format requirements for the output format, we use the\\nBLEU metric to evaluate the similarity of the output to all valid action options. The option with the\\nhighest similarity will be chosen as the action for this round.\\nOne major challenge encompassed in ALFWorld is commonsense reasoning. The agent needs to\\nextract patterns from the few-shot examples provided and combine them with the agent’s general\\nknowledge of household environments to fully understand task rules. More often than not, the as-\\nsistant tends to neglect some basic knowledge of the household environment. Thanks to the easy-to-\\nimplement multi-agent conversational feature of AutoGen , enhancing the assistant agent’s reason-\\ning ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making\\nagent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the\\nreasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the\\nassistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the\\ntask begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the\\nassistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in\\noutputting the same content or constantly apologizing.\\nWe compare our system’s performance with ReAct, which treats ALFWorld as a text-completion\\ntask. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) is a few-shot prompting technique that interleaves reasoning and\\nacting, allowing for greater synergy between the two and significantly improving performance on\\nboth language and decision-making tasks. We integrate ReAct into AutoGen by modifying the\\nprompts in a conversational manner. Following ReAct, we employ a two-shot setting. The few-\\nshot prompts are obtained from the corresponding repository. As shown in Table 3, the two-agent\\n24', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

The Writer crafts the code and inter-\\npretation, the Safeguard ensures safety (e.g., not leaking information, no malicious code), and the\\nCommander executes the code. If issues arise, the process can repeat until resolved. Shaded circles\\nrepresent steps that may be repeated multiple times.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow can be described as follows. The end user initiates the in-\\nteraction by posing a question, such as “What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery\\n2?”, marked by\\n1 to the Commander agent. The Commander manages and coordinates with two\\nLLM-based assistant agents: the Writer and the Safeguard. Apart from directing the flow of commu-\\nnication, the Commander has the responsibility of handling memory tied to user interactions. This\\ncapability enables the Commander to capture and retain valuable context regarding the user’s ques-\\ntions and their corresponding responses. Such memory is subsequently shared across the system,\\nempowering the other agents with context from prior user interactions and ensuring more informed\\nand relevant responses.\\nIn this orchestrated process, the Writer, who combines the functions of a “Coder” and an “Inter-\\npreter” as defined in (Li et al., 2023a), will craft code and also interpret execution output logs. For in-\\nstance, during code writing (\\n2 and\\n3 ), the Writer may craft code “model.addConstr(x[‘supplier1’,\\n‘roastery2’] == 0, ‘prohibit’)” to add an additional constraint to answer the user’s question.\\nAfter receiving the code, the Commander will communicate with the Safeguard to screen the code\\nand ascertain its safety (\\n4 ); once the code obtains the Safeguard’s clearance, marked by\\n5 , the\\nCommander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code and request the Writer to\\ninterpret the execution results for the user’s question (\\n6 and\\n7 ). For instance, the writer may\\nsay “if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%.”\\nBringing this intricate process full circle, the Commander furnishes the user with the concluding\\nanswer (\\n8 ).\\nIf at a point there is an exception - either a security red flag raised by Safeguard (in\\n5 ) or code\\nexecution failures within Commander, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with\\nessential information in logs (\\n6 ). So, the process from\\n3 to\\n6 might be repeated multiple times,\\nuntil each user query receives a thorough and satisfactory resolution or until the timeout. This entire\\ncomplex workflow of multi-agent interaction is elegantly managed via AutoGen .\\nThe core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines using AutoGen ,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. The new agents are customizable, conversable, and\\ncan autonomously manage their chat memories. This consolidation allows the coder and interpreter\\nroles to merge into a single “Writer” agent, resulting in a clean, concise, and intuitive implementation\\nthat is easier to maintain.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

While both sys-\\ntems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide\\nbecause the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes\\nand 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approxi-\\nmately 2.5 minutes. In contrast, OptiGuide’s average problem-solving time was around 1.5 minutes,\\nmost of which was spent waiting for responses from the GPT-4 model. This indicates a 3x saving\\non the user’s time with AutoGen -based OptiGuide.\\nWhile using ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, users had to read through the code and instructions to\\nknow where to paste the code snippets. Additionally, running the code involves downloading it and\\nexecuting it in a terminal, a process that was both time-consuming and prone to errors. The response\\ntime from the Code Interpreter is also slower, as it generates lots of tokens to read the code, read the\\nvariables line-by-line, perform chains of thought analysis, and then produce the final answer code.\\nIn contrast, AutoGen integrates multiple agents to reduce user interactions by 3 - 5 times on average\\nas reported in Table 4, where we evaluated our system with 2000 questions across five OptiGuide\\napplications and measured how many prompts the user needs to type.\\nTable 4: Manual effort saved with OptiGuide (W/ GPT-4) while preserving the same coding perfor-\\nmance is shown in the data below. The data include both the mean and standard deviations (indicated\\nin parentheses).\\nDataset netflow facility tsp coffee diet\\nSaving Ratio 3.14x (0.65) 3.14x (0.64) 4.88x (1.71) 3.38x (0.86) 3.03x (0.31)\\nTable 13 and 15 provide a detailed comparison of user experience with ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nandAutoGen -based OptiGuide. ChatGPT+Code Interpreter is unable to run code with private pack-\\nages or customized dependencies (such as Gurobi); as a consequence, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nrequires users to have engineering expertise and to manually handle multiple steps, disrupting the\\nworkflow and increasing the chance for mistakes. If customers lack access or expertise, the bur-\\nden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time. In contrast, the automated chat by\\nAutoGen is more streamlined and autonomous, integrating multiple agents to solve problems and\\naddress concerns. This results in a 5x reduction in interaction and fundamentally changes the over-\\nall usability of the system. A stable workflow can be potentially reused for other applications or to\\ncompose a larger one.\\nTakeaways: The implementation of the multi-agent design with AutoGen in the OptiGuide appli-\\ncation offers several advantages. It simplifies the Python implementation and fosters a mixture of\\ncollaborative and adversarial problem-solving environments, with the Commander and Writer work-\\ning together while the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker. This setup allows for proper\\nmemory management, as the Commander maintains memory related to user interactions, provid-\\ning context-aware decision-making. Additionally, role-playing ensures that each agent’s memory\\nremains isolated, preventing shortcuts and hallucinations\\n27', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

An example task is\\n“How much money would I earn if I bought 200 $AAPL stocks at the lowest price in the last 30 days\\nand sold them at the highest price? Save the results into a file. ” The four-agent group chat system\\ncomprised the following group members: a user proxy to take human inputs, an engineer to write\\ncode and fix bugs, a critic to review code and provide feedback, and a code executor for executing\\ncode. One of the possible alternatives is a two-agent system involving an LLM-based assistant and\\na user proxy agent, and another alternative is a group chat system with the same group members\\nbut a task-based speaker selection policy. In the task-based speaker selection policy, we simply ap-\\npend role information, chat history, and the next speaker’s task into a single prompt. Through the\\npilot study, we observed that compared with a task-style prompt, utilizing a role-play prompt in dy-\\nnamic speaker selection often leads to more effective consideration of both conversation context and\\nrole alignment during the process of generating the subsequent speaker, and consequently a higher\\nsuccess rate as reported in Table 5, fewer LLM calls and fewer termination failures, as reported in\\nTable 6.\\nTable 5: Number of successes on the 12 tasks (higher the better).\\nModel Two Agent Group Chat Group Chat with a task-based speaker selection policy\\nGPT-3.5-turbo 8 9 7\\nGPT-4 9 11 8\\nTable 6: Average # LLM calls and number of termination failures on the 12 tasks (lower the better).\\nModel Two Agent Group Chat Group Chat with a task-based speaker selection policy\\nGPT-3.5-turbo 9.9, 9 5.3, 0 4, 0\\nGPT-4 6.8, 3 4.5, 0 4, 0\\n28', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

Here,\\nthe board agent maintains the rules of the game and supports the players with information about the\\nboard. Players and the board agent all use natural language for communication.\\nIn Conversational Chess, each player is a AutoGen agent and can be powered either by a human or an\\nAI. A third party, known as the board agent, is designed to provide players with information about the\\nboard and ensure that players’ moves adhere to legal chess moves. Figure 14 illustrates the scenarios\\nsupported by Conversational Chess: AI/human vs. AI/human, and demonstrates how players and the\\nboard agent interact. This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves\\ncreatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games\\nmore entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational\\nchess).\\nTo realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options.\\nWhen human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human\\nplayer to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say\\n(such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the\\nmessage. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM\\nto parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then\\npushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error.\\nSubsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is\\nmade. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent.\\nAs shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When\\nthe player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message\\nfrom the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat\\nbetween one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps\\nkeep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.\\nThere are two notable benefits of using AutoGen to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the\\nagent design in AutoGen facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in\\nour chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat\\nmessages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly,\\nAutoGen greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition. Specifically,\\nwe utilized the register reply method supported by AutoGen agents to instantiate player agents\\nand a board agent with custom reply functions. Concentrating the extension work needed at a single\\npoint (the reply function) simplifies the reasoning processes, and development and maintenance\\neffort.\\n30', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

MiniWobChat consists of two agents: an assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant\\nagent suggests actions to manipulate the browser while the executor executes the suggested actions\\nand returns rewards/feedback. The assistant agent records the feedback and continues until the feed-\\nback indicates task success or failure.\\nIn practice, many applications require the presence of agents capable of interacting with environ-\\nments and making decisions in an online context, such as in game playing (Mnih et al., 2013; Vinyals\\net al., 2017), web interactions (Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017), and robot manipulations (Shen\\net al., 2021). With the multi-agent conversational framework in AutoGen , it becomes easy to de-\\ncompose the automatic agent-environment interactions and the development of a decision-making\\nagent by constructing an executor agent responsible for handling the interaction with the environ-\\nment, thereby delegating the decision-making part to other agents. Such a decomposition allows\\ndevelopers to reuse the decision-making agent for new tasks with minimal effort rather than build-\\ning a specialized decision-making agent for every new environment.\\nWorkflow. We demonstrate how to use AutoGen to build a working system for handling such\\nscenarios with the MiniWoB++ benchmark (Shi et al., 2017). MiniWoB++ comprises browser in-\\nteraction tasks that involve utilizing mouse and keyboard actions to interact with browsers. The\\nultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such\\nas “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires\\na sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at\\neach time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example\\nabove, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section.\\nWe designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using AutoGen , as shown in\\nFigure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in AssistantAgent and is responsible for\\nmaking action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized\\nUserProxyAgent , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions\\nsuggested by the AssistantAgent and returning feedback.\\nTo assess the performance of the developed working system, we compare it with RCI (Kim et al.,\\n2023), a recent solution for the MiniWoB++ benchmark that employs a set of self-critiquing prompts\\nand has achieved state-of-the-art performance. In our evaluation, we use all available tasks in the\\nofficial RCI code, with varying degrees of difficulty, to conduct a comprehensive analysis against\\nMiniWobChat. Figure 18 illustrates that MiniWobChat achieves competitive performance in this\\nevaluation8. Specifically, among the 49 available tasks, MiniWobChat achieves a success rate of\\n52.8%, which is only 3.6%lower than RCI, a method specifically designed for the MiniWob++\\nbenchmark. It is worth noting that in most tasks, the difference between the two methods is mirrored\\nas shown in Figure 18.

       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are becoming a crucial building block in developing powerful agents\\nthat utilize LLMs for reasoning, tool usage, and adapting to new observations (Yao et al., 2022; Xi\\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks. Given the expanding tasks that could\\nbenefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of\\nagents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help\\nencourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023),\\nand provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is\\nintriguing to ask the following question: how can we facilitate the development of LLM applications\\nthat could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?\\nOur insight is to use multi-agent conversations to achieve it. There are at least three reasons con-\\nfirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat-\\noptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate\\nthrough conversations with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea-\\nsoning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad\\nrange of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings),\\nconversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities\\nin a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex\\ntasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this\\npartitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and\\nsupport different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten-\\ntially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent\\nconversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil-\\nity to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions:\\n(1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in\\nmulti-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can\\naccommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying\\ncomplexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different\\nconversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and\\nstatic vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent\\ninteractions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would\\nlimit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.\\nWhile there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a\\ngeneralized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts.\\n1Customizable and conversable agents. AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-\\nage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can\\neasily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code,\\nwire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in\\ncapabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors.\\nTo make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made conversable –\\nthey can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold\\nmultiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer-\\ntain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the\\nstrong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat\\nand also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1)\\n2Conversation programming. A fundamental insight of AutoGen is to simplify and unify com-\\nplex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So AutoGen adopts a program-\\nming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as\\nconversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two\\nprimary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as\\ndescribed above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-\\ncentric computation andcontrol . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-\\ngramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent\\nbehaviors. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and\\nexperimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)\\n3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents\\nand conversation programming. These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support\\napplications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities. Moreover, we perform both\\nevaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications. The results show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,\\nwhile reducing development effort. (Section 3 and Appendix D)\\n2 The AutoGen Framework\\nTo reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-\\nmains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows\\nusing multi-agent conversations. This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-\\nmented agents. This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and\\nconversation programming.\\n2.1 Conversable Agents\\nInAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and\\nreceive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation. It\\nmaintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess\\na set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc. The agents can act according\\nto programmed behavior patterns described next.\\nAgent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools. Since an agent’s capabilities directly\\ninfluence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents\\nwith various capabilities. AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,\\nincluding 1) LLMs. LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role\\nplaying, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing\\nfeedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways\\nvia novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. AutoGen also offers\\nenhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,\\nvia an enhanced LLM inference layer. 2) Humans. Human involvement is desired or even essential\\nin many LLM applications. AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-\\nbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on\\nthe agent configuration. The default user proxy agent allows configurable human involvement levels\\nand patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for\\nhumans to skip providing input. 3) Tools. Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools\\nvia code execution or function execution. For example, the default user proxy agent in AutoGen is\\nable to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls.\\nAgent customization and cooperation. Based on application-specific needs, each agent can be\\nconfigured to have a mix of basic back-end types to display complex behavior in multi-agent con-\\nversations. AutoGen allows easy creation of agents with specialized capabilities and roles by reusing\\nor extending the built-in agents. The yellow-shaded area of Figure 2 provides a sketch of the built-in\\nagents in AutoGen . The ConversableAgent class is the highest-level agent abstraction and, by\\ndefault, can use LLMs, humans, and tools. The AssistantAgent andUserProxyAgent are two\\npre-configured ConversableAgent subclasses, each representing a common usage mode, i.e., act-\\ning as an AI assistant (backed by LLMs) and acting as a human proxy to solicit human input or\\nexecute code/function calls (backed by humans and/or tools).\\nIn the example on the right-hand side of Figure 1, an LLM-backed assistant agent and a tool- and\\nhuman-backed user proxy agent are deployed together to tackle a task. Here, the assistant agent\\ngenerates a solution with the help of LLMs and passes the solution to the user proxy agent. Then,\\nthe user proxy agent solicits human inputs or executes the assistant’s code and passes the results as\\nfeedback back to the assistant.\\n4Appendix C presents an example of such novel prompting techniques which empowers the default LLM-\\nbacked assistant agent in AutoGen to converse with other agents in multi-step problem solving.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The top sub-\\nfigure illustrates the built-in agents provided by AutoGen , which have unified conversation interfaces\\nand can be customized. The middle sub-figure shows an example of using AutoGen to develop\\na two-agent system with a custom reply function. The bottom sub-figure illustrates the resulting\\nautomated agent chat from the two-agent system during program execution.\\nBy allowing custom agents that can converse with each other, conversable agents in AutoGen serve\\nas a useful building block. However, to develop applications where agents make meaningful progress\\non tasks, developers also need to be able to specify and mold these multi-agent conversations.\\n2.2 Conversation Programming\\nAs a solution to the above problem, AutoGen utilizes conversation programming , a paradigm that\\nconsiders two concepts: the first is computation – the actions agents take to compute their response\\nin a multi-agent conversation. And the second is control flow – the sequence (or conditions) un-\\nder which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to\\nprogram these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In AutoGen , these\\ncomputations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is\\ninvolved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina-\\ntion condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’\\ndecisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the\\ninter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow\\nas agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.\\nFigure 2 provides a simple illustration. The bottom sub-figure shows how individual agents perform\\ntheir role-specific, conversation-centric computations to generate responses (e.g., via LLM inference\\ncalls and code execution). The task progresses through conversations displayed in the dialog box.\\nThe middle sub-figure demonstrates a conversation-based control flow. When the assistant receives\\na message, the user proxy agent typically sends the human input as a reply. If there is no input, it\\nexecutes any code in the assistant’s message instead.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen features the following design patterns to facilitate conversation programming:\\n1.Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat. Agents in\\nAutoGen have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation-\\ncentric computation, including a send/receive function for sending/receiving messages and a\\ngenerate reply function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received\\nmessage. AutoGen also introduces and by default adopts an agent auto-reply mechanism to\\nrealize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au-\\ntomatically invokes generate reply and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination\\ncondition is satisfied. AutoGen provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code\\nor function execution, or human input. One can also register custom reply functions to customize\\nthe behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender\\nagent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is\\ninitialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds\\nnaturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation\\nflow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”)\\nof Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation\\nwould proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Pro-\\ngram Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and\\nunified way to define the workflow.\\n2.Control by fusion of programming and natural language. AutoGen allows the usage of\\nprogramming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1) Natural-\\nlanguage control via LLMs. InAutoGen , one can control the conversation flow by prompting\\nthe LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the\\nbuilt-in AssistantAgent inAutoGen uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors\\nand generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent\\nto confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to\\nconsume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are\\ncompleted to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can\\nbe found in Appendix C. 2) Programming-language control. InAutoGen , Python code can be\\nused to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the\\nmax number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control\\nthe conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “Conversation-\\nDriven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3) Control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. AutoGen also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM\\ninference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from nat-\\nural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).\\nIn the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse\\npatterns. In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, AutoGen also supports dynamic\\nconversation flows with multiple agents. AutoGen provides two general ways to achieve this: 1)\\nCustomized generate reply function: within the customized generate reply function, one\\nagent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending\\non the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides\\nwhether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging\\nadditional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In\\naddition, AutoGen supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in GroupChatManager ,\\nwhich can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We\\nelaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems\\nto showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.\\n3 Applications of AutoGen\\nWe demonstrate six applications using AutoGen (see Figure 3) to illustrate its potential in simplify-\\ning the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected\\nbased on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-\\nities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6). Together, these\\ncriteria showcase AutoGen ’s role in advancing the LLM-application landscape.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,\\nincluding open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-\\nAct (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and\\nChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize\\nthe results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and\\non the entire5test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-\\nready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including\\nthe commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process\\nwith the help of AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one only needs to set\\nhuman input mode=‘ALWAYS’ in the UserProxyAgent of the system in scenario 1. We demon-\\nstrate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that\\ncannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where\\nmultiple human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our\\nexperiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or\\nnew experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of\\nthe evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.\\nA2: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\\nRetrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic\\nlimitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this section, we employ AutoGen to\\nbuild a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system (Lewis et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2021)\\nnamed Retrieval-augmented Chat. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User\\nProxy agent and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, both of which are extended from built-in\\nagents from AutoGen . The Retrieval-augmented User Proxy includes a vector database (Chroma,\\n5We did not evaluate ChatGPT on the whole dataset since it requires substantial manual effort and is re-\\nstricted by its hourly message-number limitation.

A detailed\\nworkflow description of the Retrieval-augmented Chat is provided in Appendix D.\\nWe evaluate Retrieval-augmented Chat in both question-answering and code-generation scenarios.\\n(Scenario 1 ) We first perform an evaluation regarding natural question answering on the Natural\\nQuestions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and report results in Figure 4b. In this evaluation, we\\ncompare our system with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) following an existing evaluation6prac-\\ntice (Adlakha et al., 2023). Leveraging the conversational design and natural-language control,\\nAutoGen introduces a novel interactive retrieval feature in this application: whenever the retrieved\\ncontext does not contain the information, instead of terminating, the LLM-based assistant would\\nreply “ Sorry, I cannot find any information about... UPDATE CONTEXT. ” which will invoke more\\nretrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say “I\\ndon’t know” instead of “UPDATE CONTEXT. ” in cases where relevant information is not found,\\nand report results in Figure 4b. The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed\\nplays a non-trivial role in the process. We give a concrete example and results using this appealing\\nfeature in Appendix D. ( Scenario 2 ) We further demonstrate how Retrieval-augmented Chat aids in\\ngenerating code based on a given codebase that contains code not included in GPT-4’s training data.\\nEvaluation and demonstration details for both scenarios are included in Appendix D.\\n6The results of DPR with GPT-3.5 shown in Figure 4b are from (Adlakha et al., 2023). We use GPT-3.5 as\\na shorthand for GPT-3.5-turbo.\\n7', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A3: Decision Making in Text World Environments\\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate how AutoGen can be used to develop effective applications that\\ninvolve interactive or online decision making. We perform the study using the ALFWorld (Shridhar\\net al., 2021) benchmark, which includes a diverse collection of synthetic language-based interactive\\ndecision-making tasks in household environments.\\nWith AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld. It consists of\\nan LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor\\nagent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates Re-\\nAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge\\nencountered in both ReAct and the AutoGen -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to\\nleverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the\\nsystem getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of AutoGen\\nallows us to address this issue effectively: With AutoGen , we are able to introduce a grounding\\nagent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as “You must find and take the object\\nbefore you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it. ” –whenever\\nthe system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to\\navoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants\\nof our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct7on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report\\nresults in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15%\\nperformance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding\\nagent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly miti-\\ngated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error\\nloops. For an example trajectory comparing the systems see Appendix D, Figure 10.\\nA4: Multi-Agent Coding\\nIn this subsection, we use AutoGen to build a multi-agent coding system based on OptiGuide (Li\\net al., 2023a), a system that excels at writing code to interpret optimization solutions and answer\\nuser questions, such as exploring the implications of changing a supply-chain decision or under-\\nstanding why the optimizer made a particular choice. The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the\\nAutoGen -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as\\n“What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2? ” to the Commander agent. The Com-\\nmander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer\\nthe question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the\\ncode, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will\\nuse external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution\\nresults. For instance, the writer may say “ if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the\\ntotal cost would increase by 10.5%. ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the\\nend user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the\\nCommander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information. The process might\\nbe repeated multiple times until the user’s question is answered or timed-out.\\nWith AutoGen the core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. We provide a detailed comparison of user expe-\\nrience with ChatGPT+Code Interpreter and AutoGen -based OptiGuide in Appendix D, where we\\nshow that AutoGen -based OptiGuide could save around 3x of user’s time and reduce user interac-\\ntions by 3 - 5 times on average. We also conduct an ablation showing that multi-agent abstraction is\\nnecessary. Specifically, we construct a single-agent approach where a single agent conducts both the\\ncode-writing and safeguard processes. We tested the single- and multi-agent approaches on a dataset\\nof 100 coding tasks, which is crafted to include equal numbers of safe and unsafe tasks. Evaluation\\nresults as reported in Figure 4d show that the multi-agent design boosts the F-1 score in identifying\\nunsafe code by 8% (with GPT-4) and 35% (with GPT-3.5-turbo).\\n7Results of ReAct are obtained by directly running its official code with default settings. The code uses\\ntext-davinci-003 as backend LM and does not support GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A5: Dynamic Group Chat\\nAutoGen provides native support for a dynamic group chat communication pattern, in which par-\\nticipating agents share the same context and converse with the others in a dynamic manner instead\\nof following a pre-defined order. Dynamic group chat relies on ongoing conversations to guide the\\nflow of interaction among agents. These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where col-\\nlaboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In AutoGen , the GroupChatManager\\nclass serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps:\\ndynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting\\nthe message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style\\nprompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared\\nto a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effec-\\ntive consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and\\nspeaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls.\\nWe include detailed results in Appendix D.\\nA6: Conversational Chess\\nUsing AutoGen , we developed Conversational Chess, a natural language interface game shown in\\nthe last sub-figure of Figure 3. It features built-in agents for players, which can be human or LLM,\\nand a third-party board agent to provide information and validate moves based on standard rules.\\nWith AutoGen , we enabled two essential features: (1) Natural, flexible, and engaging game dynam-\\nics, enabled by the customizable agent design in AutoGen . Conversational Chess supports a range\\nof game-play patterns, including AI-AI, AI-human, and human-human, with seamless switching\\nbetween these modes during a single game. An illustrative example of these entertaining game dy-\\nnamics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain\\ngame integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move\\nis invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move\\nbefore continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con-\\nsistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied\\non a relevant prompt “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves” to\\nground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused\\ngame disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board\\nagent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants. A comprehensive demon-\\nstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D.\\n4 Discussion\\nWe introduced an open-source library, AutoGen , that incorporates the paradigms of conversable\\nagents and conversation programming. This library utilizes capable agents that are well-suited for\\nmulti-agent cooperation. It features a unified conversation interface among the agents, along with\\nan auto-reply mechanisms, which help establish an agent-interaction interface that capitalizes on the\\nstrengths of chat-optimized LLMs with broad capabilities while accommodating a wide range of\\napplications. AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating and experimenting with multi-\\nagent systems that can easily fulfill various practical requirements, such as reusing, customizing,\\nand extending existing agents, as well as programming conversations between them.\\nOur experiments, as detailed in Section 3, demonstrate that this approach offers numerous benefits.\\nThe adoption of AutoGen has resulted in improved performance (over state-of-the-art approaches),\\nreduced development code, and decreased manual burden for existing applications. It offers flex-\\nibility to developers, as demonstrated in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, where AutoGen enables\\nmulti-agent chats to follow a dynamic pattern rather than fixed back-and-forth interactions. It allows\\nhumans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner. Despite the\\ncomplexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent\\ncooperation), the implementation based on AutoGen remains straightforward. Dividing tasks among\\nseparate agents promotes modularity. Furthermore, since each agent can be developed, tested, and\\nmaintained separately, this approach simplifies overall development and code management.\\n9', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although this work is still in its early experimental stages, it paves the way for numerous future\\ndirections and research opportunities. For instance, we can explore effective integration of existing\\nagent implementations into our multi-agent framework and investigate the optimal balance between\\nautomation and human control in multi-agent workflows. As we further develop and refine AutoGen ,\\nwe aim to investigate which strategies, such as agent topology and conversation patterns, lead to the\\nmost effective multi-agent conversations while optimizing the overall efficiency, among other fac-\\ntors. While increasing the number of agents and other degrees of freedom presents opportunities for\\ntackling more complex problems, it may also introduce new safety challenges that require additional\\nstudies and careful consideration.\\nWe provide more discussion in Appendix B, including guidelines for using AutoGen and direction\\nof future work. We hope AutoGen will help improve many LLM applications in terms of speed of\\ndevelopment, ease of experimentation, and overall effectiveness and safety. We actively welcome\\ncontributions from the broader community.\\nEthics statement\\nThere are several potential ethical considerations that could arise from the development and use of\\ntheAutoGen framework.\\n• Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations\\nbetween agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that\\ndevelopers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy.\\n• Bias and Fairness: LLMs have been shown to exhibit biases present in their training data (Navigli\\net al., 2023). When using LLMs in the AutoGen framework, it is crucial to address and mitigate\\nany biases that may arise in the conversations between agents. Developers should be aware of\\npotential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity.\\n• Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in-\\nvolves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability\\nand transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making\\nprocess of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues\\nor biases.\\n• Trust and Reliance: AutoGen leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing\\nautomation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this\\ninteraction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user\\neducation about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019).\\n• Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa-\\ntion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. In particular, allowing LLM agents to\\nmake changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing\\npackages, could be risky. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that\\nappropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work presented in this report was made possible through discussions and feedback from Peter\\nLee, Johannes Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Steven Lucco, Umesh Madan, Robin Moeur, Piali Choud-\\nhury, Saleema Amershi, Adam Fourney, Victor Dibia, Guoqing Zheng, Corby Rosset, Ricky Loynd,\\nEce Kamar, Rafah Hosn, John Langford, Ida Momennejad, Brian Krabach, Taylor Webb, Shanka\\nSubhra Mondal, Wei-ge Chen, Robert Gruen, Yinan Li, Yue Wang, Suman Nath, Tanakorn Leesat-\\napornwongsa, Xin Wang, Shishir Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Saehan Jo, Ishai Menache, Kontantina Mel-\\nlou, Runlong Zhou, Feiran Jia, Hamed Khanpour, Hamid Palangi, Srinagesh Sharma, Julio Albinati\\nCortez, Amin Saied, Yuzhe Ma, Dujian Ding, Linyong Nan, Prateek Yadav, Shannon Shen, Ankur\\nMallick, Mark Encarnaci ´on, Lars Liden, Tianwei Yue, Julia Kiseleva, Anastasia Razdaibiedina, and\\nLuciano Del Corro.

       " Document(page_content='A Related Work\\nWe examine existing LLM-based agent systems or frameworks that can be used to build LLM appli-\\ncations. We categorize the related work into single-agent and multi-agent systems and specifically\\nprovide a summary of differentiators comparing AutoGen with existing multi-agent systems in Ta-\\nble 1. Note that many of these systems are evolving open-source projects, so the remarks and\\nstatements about them may only be accurate as of the time of writing. We refer interested readers to\\ndetailed LLM-based agent surveys (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b)\\nSingle-Agent Systems:\\n•AutoGPT : AutoGPT is an open-source implementation of an AI agent that attempts to au-\\ntonomously achieve a given goal (AutoGPT, 2023). It follows a single-agent paradigm in which\\nit augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration.\\n•ChatGPT+ (with code interpreter or plugin) : ChatGPT, a conversational AI service or agent,\\ncan now be used alongside a code interpreter or plugin (currently available only under the pre-\\nmium subscription plan ChatGPT Plus) (OpenAI, 2023). The code interpreter enables ChatGPT\\nto execute code, while the plugin enhances ChatGPT with a wide range of curated tools.\\n•LangChain Agents : LangChain is a general framework for developing LLM-based applica-\\ntions (LangChain, 2023). LangChain Agents is a subpackage for using an LLM to choose a\\nsequence of actions. There are various types of agents in LangChain Agents, with the ReAct agent\\nbeing a notable example that combines reasoning and acting when using LLMs (mainly designed\\nfor LLMs prior to ChatGPT) (Yao et al., 2022). All agents provided in LangChain Agents fol-\\nlow a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative\\nmodes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these lim-\\nitations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not\\nbased on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain\\nlies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped\\nby LangChain and the corresponding interface.\\n•Transformers Agent : Transformers Agent (HuggingFace, 2023) is an experimental natural-\\nlanguage API built on the transformers repository. It includes a set of curated tools and an agent\\nto interpret natural language and use these tools. Similar to AutoGPT, it follows a single-agent\\nparadigm and does not support agent collaboration.\\nAutoGen differs from the single-agent systems above by supporting multi-agent LLM applications.\\nMulti-Agent Systems:\\n•BabyAGI : BabyAGI (BabyAGI, 2023) is an example implementation of an AI-powered task man-\\nagement system in a Python script. In this implemented system, multiple LLM-based agents\\nare used. For example, there is an agent for creating new tasks based on the objective and the\\nresult of the previous task, an agent for prioritizing the task list, and an agent for completing\\ntasks/sub-tasks. As a multi-agent system, BabyAGI adopts a static agent conversation pattern,\\ni.e., a predefined order of agent communication, while AutoGen supports both static and dynamic\\nconversation patterns and additionally supports tool usage and human involvement.\\n•CAMEL : CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b) is a communicative agent framework. It demonstrates\\nhow role playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task comple-\\ntion. It also records agent conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. An\\nInception-prompting technique is used to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. Un-\\nlikeAutoGen , CAMEL does not natively support tool usage, such as code execution. Although it\\nis proposed as an infrastructure for multi-agent conversation, it only supports static conversation\\npatterns, while AutoGen additionally supports dynamic conversation patterns.\\n•Multi-Agent Debate: Two recent works investigate and show that multi-agent debate is an effec-\\ntive way to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs (Liang et al., 2023) and to improve the factuality\\nand reasoning of LLMs (Du et al., 2023). In both works, multiple LLM inference instances are\\nconstructed as multiple agents to solve problems with agent debate. Each agent is simply an LLM\\ninference instance, while no tool or human is involved, and the inter-agent conversation needs\\nto follow a pre-defined order. These works attempt to build LLM applications with multi-agent\\nconversation, while AutoGen , designed as a generic infrastructure, can be used to facilitate this\\ndevelopment and enable more applications with dynamic conversation patterns.\\n14', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='B Expanded Discussion\\nThe applications in Section 3 show how AutoGen not only enables new applications but also helps\\nrenovate existing ones. For example, in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, AutoGen enabled the cre-\\nation of multi-agent conversations that follow a dynamic pattern instead of a fixed back-and-forth.\\nAnd in both A5 and A6, humans can participate in the activities together with multiple other AI\\nagents in a conversational manner. Similarly, A1-A4 show how popular applications can be reno-\\nvated quickly with AutoGen . Despite the complexity of these applications (most of them involve\\nmore than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent cooperation), our AutoGen -based implementa-\\ntion remains simple, demonstrating promising opportunities to build creative applications and a large\\nspace for innovation. In reflecting on why these benefits can be achieved in these applications with\\nAutoGen , we believe there are a few reasons:\\n•Ease of use : The built-in agents can be used out-of-the-box, delivering strong performance even\\nwithout any customization. (A1, A3)\\n•Modularity : The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each\\nagent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall develop-\\nment process and facilitating code management. (A3, A4, A5, and A6)\\n•Programmability: AutoGen allows users to extend/customize existing agents to develop systems\\nsatisfying their specific needs with ease. (A1-A6). For example, with AutoGen , the core workflow\\ncode in A4 is reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines, for a 4x saving.\\n•Allowing human involvement :AutoGen provides a native mechanism to achieve human partici-\\npation and/or human oversight. With AutoGen , humans can seamlessly and optionally cooperate\\nwith AIs to solve problems or generally participate in the activity. AutoGen also facilitates inter-\\nactive user instructions to ensure the process stays on the desired path. (A1, A2, A5, and A6)\\n•Collaborative/adversarial agent interactions : Like many collaborative agent systems (Dong\\net al., 2023), agents in AutoGen can share information and knowledge, to complement each other’s\\nabilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. (A1, A2, A3, and A4). Analogously, in certain\\nscenarios, some agents are required to work in an adversarial way. Relevant information is shared\\namong different conversations in a controlled manner, preventing distraction or hallucination. (A4,\\nA6). AutoGen supports both patterns, enabling effective utilization and augmentation of LLMs.\\nB.1 General Guidelines for Using AutoGen\\nBelow we give some recommendations for using agents in AutoGen to accomplish a task.\\n1.Consider using built-in agents first. For example, AssistantAgent is pre-configured to be\\nbacked by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via\\ncode. The UserProxyAgent is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution.\\nMany problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents\\nfor an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition,\\ncode execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an\\nagent; (2) AutoGen supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective\\nway to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3) UserProxyAgent\\ncan be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys-\\ntem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its\\nconversation flow with natural language.\\n2.Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat\\nsetup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can\\nbe easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a\\ndynamic way.\\n3. Try to reuse built-in reply methods based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a\\ncustom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way\\n(e.g., the built-in agent GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply\\nfunction when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3).\\n4. When developing a new application with UserProxyAgent ,start with humans always in\\nthe loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au-\\ntonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis-\\ncovering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting\\n16', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='human input mode = ‘NEVER’. This enables LLM as a backend, and one can either use the\\nLLM or manually generate diverse system messages to simulate different use cases.\\n5. Despite the numerous advantages of AutoGen agents, there could be cases/scenarios where other\\nlibraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements\\nfor back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and-\\nforth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023),\\nLlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023),\\nGorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM\\ninference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are\\nhelpful, one can use them as tool backends for AutoGen agents. For example, one can readily use\\ntools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in AutoGen agent. (3) For specific applications, one\\nmay want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could\\nwrap those agents as conversable agents in AutoGen and then use them to build LLM applications\\nthrough multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among\\nmany tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages\\nlike ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with AutoGen to automate such tuning.\\nB.2 Future Work\\nThis work raises many research questions and future directions and .\\nDesigning optimal multi-agent workflows: Creating a multi-agent workflow for a given task can\\ninvolve many decisions, e.g., how many agents to include, how to assign agent roles and agent\\ncapabilities, how the agents should interact with each other, and whether to automate a particular\\npart of the workflow. There may not exist a one-fits-all answer, and the best solution might depend\\non the specific application. This raises important questions: For what types of tasks and applications\\nare multi-agent workflows most useful? How do multiple agents help in different applications? For\\na given task, what is the optimal (e.g., cost-effective) multi-agent workflow?\\nCreating highly capable agents: AutoGen can enable the development of highly capable agents\\nthat leverage the strengths of LLMs, tools, and humans. Creating such agents is crucial to ensuring\\nthat a multi-agent workflow can effectively troubleshoot and make progress on a task. For example,\\nwe observed that CAMEL, another multi-agent LLM system, cannot effectively solve problems in\\nmost cases primarily because it lacks the capability to execute tools or code. This failure shows that\\nLLMs and multi-agent conversations with simple role playing are insufficient, and highly capable\\nagents with diverse skill sets are essential. We believe that more systematic work will be required to\\ndevelop guidelines for application-specific agents, to create a large OSS knowledge base of agents,\\nand to create agents that can discover and upgrade their skills (Cai et al., 2023).\\nEnabling scale, safety, and human agency: Section 3 shows how complex multi-agent workflows\\ncan enable new applications, and future work will be needed to assess whether scaling further can\\nhelp solve extremely complex tasks. However, as these workflows scale and grow more complex,\\nit may become difficult to log and adjust them. Thus, it will become essential to develop clear\\nmechanisms and tools to track and debug their behavior. Otherwise, these techniques risk resulting\\nin incomprehensible, unintelligible chatter among agents (Lewis et al., 2017).\\nOur work also shows how complex, fully autonomous workflows with AutoGen can be useful, but\\nfully autonomous agent conversations will need to be used with care. While the autonomous mode\\nAutoGen supports could be desirable in many scenarios, a high level of autonomy can also pose\\npotential risks, especially in high-risk applications (Amodei et al., 2016; Weld & Etzioni, 1994). As\\na result, building fail-safes against cascading failures and exploitation, mitigating reward hacking,\\nout of control and undesired behaviors, maintaining effective human oversight of applications built\\nwith AutoGen agents will become important. While AutoGen provides convenient and seamless\\ninvolvement of humans through a user proxy agent, developers and stakeholders still need to under-\\nstand and determine the appropriate level and pattern of human involvement to ensure the safe and\\nethical use of the technology (Horvitz, 1999; Amershi et al., 2019).\\n17', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

From these\\nevaluations, we have the following observations regarding the problem-solving success rate and\\nuser experience of these systems:\\n• Problem-solving success rate: Results from the quantitative evaluations show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve the highest problem-solving success rate among all the compared methods. The qual-\\nitative evaluations elucidate common failure reasons across several alternative approaches.

The LangChain\\nagent also fails on both problems, producing code that results in incorrect answers in all trials.\\n• Based on the qualitative evaluation, we analyze the user experience concerning the verbosity of\\nthe response and the ability of the LLM-based system to run without unexpected behaviors. Chat-\\nGPT+Plugin is the least verbose, mainly because Wolfram queries are much shorter than Python\\ncode. AutoGen , ChatGPT+Code Interpreter, and LangChain exhibit similar verbosity, although\\nLangChain is slightly more verbose due to more code execution errors.

Input the problem: Find the equation of the plane which bisects the angle\\nbetween the planes 3x−6y+ 2z+ 5 = 0 and4x−12y+ 3z−3 = 0 ,and which\\ncontains the point (−5,−1,−5).Enter your answer in the form\\nAx+By+Cz+D= 0,\\nwhere A, B, C, D are integers such that A > 0and\\ngcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.\\n2.

Please\\nset up this equation first.\\n3. We expect the system to give the correct distance equation. Since the equation involves\\nan absolute sign that is hard to solve, we would give the next hint: Consider the two\\ncases to remove the abs sign and get two possible solutions.\\n4. If the system returns the two possible solutions and doesn’t continue to the next step, we\\ngive the last hint: Use point (-5,-1,-5) to determine which is correct and\\ngive the final answer.\\n5.

ChatGPT+Code\\nInterpreter and ChatGPT+Plugin managed to solve the problem in two out of three trials, while Au-\\ntoGPT failed to solve it in all three attempts. In its unsuccessful attempt, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nfailed to adhere to human hints. In its failed trial, ChatGPT+Plugin produced an almost correct solu-\\ntion but had a sign discrepancy in the final answer. AutoGPT was unable to yield a correct solution\\nin any of the trials.

Next-generation LLM applications may necessitate\\nthe involvement of multiple real users for collectively solving a problem with the assistance of\\nLLMs. We showcase how AutoGen can be leveraged to effortlessly construct such a system. Specif-\\nically, building upon scenario 2 mentioned above, we aim to devise a simple system involving two\\nhuman users: a student and an expert. In this setup, the student interacts with an LLM assistant to\\naddress some problems, and the LLM automatically resorts to the expert when necessary.\\nThe overall workflow is as follows: The student chats with the LLM-based assistant agent through\\na student proxy agent to solve problems. When the assistant cannot solve the problem satisfactorily,\\nor the solution does not match the expectation of the student, it would automatically hold the con-\\nversation and call the pre-defined askforexpert function via the function callfeature of GPT\\nin order to resort to the expert. Specifically, it would automatically produce the initial message for\\ntheaskforexpert function, which could be the statement of the problem or the request to verify\\nthe solution to a problem, and the expert is supposed to respond to this message with the help of\\nthe expert assistant. After the conversation between the expert and the expert’s assistant, the final\\nmessage would be sent back to the student assistant as the response to the initial message. Then, the\\nstudent assistant would resume the conversation with the student using the response from the expert\\nfor a better solution. A detailed visualization is shown in Figure 6.\\nWith AutoGen , constructing the student/expert proxy agent and the assistant agents is straight-\\nforward by reusing the built-in UserProxyAgent andAssistantAgent through appropriate\\nconfigurations. The only development required involves writing several lines of code for the\\naskforexpert function, which then becomes part of the configuration for the assistant. Ad-\\nditionally, it’s easy to extend such a system to include more than one expert, with a specific\\naskforexpert function for each, or to include multiple student users with a shared expert for\\nconsultation.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Agents converse until they find a satisfactory answer.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow of Retrieval-Augmented Chat is illustrated in Figure 7. To\\nuse Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\\n1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding simi-\\nlarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based\\non the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it\\nis instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\\n3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and\\nsends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it\\nterminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along\\nwith the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation\\nis enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n4. If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar\\nchunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it\\ngenerates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate\\nan answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times.\\nThe conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.\\nWe utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat in two scenarios. The first scenario aids in generating code\\nbased on a given codebase. While LLMs possess strong coding abilities, they are unable to utilize\\npackages or APIs that are not included in their training data, e.g., private codebases, or have trouble\\nusing trained ones that are frequently updated post-training. Hence, Retrieval-Augmented Code\\nGeneration is considered to be highly valuable. The second scenario involves question-answering\\non the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), enabling us to obtain comparative\\nevaluation metrics for the performance of our system.\\nScenario 1: Evaluation on Natural Questions QA dataset. In this case, we evaluate the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Chat’s end-to-end question-answering performance using the Natural Ques-\\ntions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019).

Consequently, the original GPT-4 model is unable to generate the\\ncorrect code, due to its lack of knowledge regarding Spark-related APIs. Instead, it erroneously cre-\\nates a non-existent parameter, spark , and sets it to True’. Nevertheless, with Retrieval-Augmented\\nChat, we provide the latest reference documents as context.

We propose two designs: a two-agent design where the assistant\\nagent suggests the next step, and the Executor executes actions and provides feedback. The three-\\nagent design adds a grounding agent that supplies commonsense facts to the executor when needed.\\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a synthetic language-based interactive decision-making task.\\nIt comprises textual environments that aim to simulate real-world household scenes. Given a high-\\nlevel goal (e.g., putting a hot apple in the fridge) and the description of the household environment,\\nthe agent needs to explore and interact with the simulated household environment through a textual\\ninterface. A typical task environment contains various types of locations and could require more\\nthan 40 steps to finish, which highlights the need for agents to decompose the goal into subtasks and\\ntackle them one by one, while effectively exploring the environments.\\nDetailed Workflow. We first propose a straightforward two-agent system with AutoGen , illustrated\\non the left-hand side of Figure 9, to tackle tasks from this benchmark. The system consists of\\nan assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant agent generates plans and makes action\\ndecisions to solve the tasks. The executor agent is tailored specifically for ALFWorld. It performs\\nactions proposed by the assistant and reports action execution results in the household environment\\nas feedback to the assistant. Due to the strict format requirements for the output format, we use the\\nBLEU metric to evaluate the similarity of the output to all valid action options. The option with the\\nhighest similarity will be chosen as the action for this round.\\nOne major challenge encompassed in ALFWorld is commonsense reasoning. The agent needs to\\nextract patterns from the few-shot examples provided and combine them with the agent’s general\\nknowledge of household environments to fully understand task rules. More often than not, the as-\\nsistant tends to neglect some basic knowledge of the household environment. Thanks to the easy-to-\\nimplement multi-agent conversational feature of AutoGen , enhancing the assistant agent’s reason-\\ning ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making\\nagent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the\\nreasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the\\nassistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the\\ntask begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the\\nassistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in\\noutputting the same content or constantly apologizing.\\nWe compare our system’s performance with ReAct, which treats ALFWorld as a text-completion\\ntask. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) is a few-shot prompting technique that interleaves reasoning and\\nacting, allowing for greater synergy between the two and significantly improving performance on\\nboth language and decision-making tasks. We integrate ReAct into AutoGen by modifying the\\nprompts in a conversational manner. Following ReAct, we employ a two-shot setting. The few-\\nshot prompts are obtained from the corresponding repository.

With the introduction of a grounding agent, the assistant\\ncan break out of this loop and successfully complete the task\\nTakeaways. We introduced a grounding agent to serve as an external commonsense knowledge\\nsource, which significantly enhanced the assistant’s ability to make informed decisions.

The Writer crafts the code and inter-\\npretation, the Safeguard ensures safety (e.g., not leaking information, no malicious code), and the\\nCommander executes the code. If issues arise, the process can repeat until resolved. Shaded circles\\nrepresent steps that may be repeated multiple times.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow can be described as follows. The end user initiates the in-\\nteraction by posing a question, such as “What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery\\n2?”, marked by\\n1 to the Commander agent. The Commander manages and coordinates with two\\nLLM-based assistant agents: the Writer and the Safeguard. Apart from directing the flow of commu-\\nnication, the Commander has the responsibility of handling memory tied to user interactions. This\\ncapability enables the Commander to capture and retain valuable context regarding the user’s ques-\\ntions and their corresponding responses. Such memory is subsequently shared across the system,\\nempowering the other agents with context from prior user interactions and ensuring more informed\\nand relevant responses.\\nIn this orchestrated process, the Writer, who combines the functions of a “Coder” and an “Inter-\\npreter” as defined in (Li et al., 2023a), will craft code and also interpret execution output logs. For in-\\nstance, during code writing (\\n2 and\\n3 ), the Writer may craft code “model.addConstr(x[‘supplier1’,\\n‘roastery2’] == 0, ‘prohibit’)” to add an additional constraint to answer the user’s question.\\nAfter receiving the code, the Commander will communicate with the Safeguard to screen the code\\nand ascertain its safety (\\n4 ); once the code obtains the Safeguard’s clearance, marked by\\n5 , the\\nCommander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code and request the Writer to\\ninterpret the execution results for the user’s question (\\n6 and\\n7 ). For instance, the writer may\\nsay “if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%.”\\nBringing this intricate process full circle, the Commander furnishes the user with the concluding\\nanswer (\\n8 ).\\nIf at a point there is an exception - either a security red flag raised by Safeguard (in\\n5 ) or code\\nexecution failures within Commander, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with\\nessential information in logs (\\n6 ). So, the process from\\n3 to\\n6 might be repeated multiple times,\\nuntil each user query receives a thorough and satisfactory resolution or until the timeout. This entire\\ncomplex workflow of multi-agent interaction is elegantly managed via AutoGen .\\nThe core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines using AutoGen ,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. The new agents are customizable, conversable, and\\ncan autonomously manage their chat memories. This consolidation allows the coder and interpreter\\nroles to merge into a single “Writer” agent, resulting in a clean, concise, and intuitive implementation\\nthat is easier to maintain.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

If users lack access or expertise,\\nthe burden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time.\\nWe carried out a user study that juxtaposed OpenAI’s ChatGPT coupled with a Code Interpreter\\nagainst AutoGen -based OptiGuide. The study focused on a coffee supply chain scenario, and an\\nexpert Python programmer with proficiency in Gurobi participated in the test. We evaluated both\\nsystems based on 10 randomly selected questions, measuring time and accuracy. While both sys-\\ntems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide\\nbecause the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes\\nand 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approxi-\\nmately 2.5 minutes. In contrast, OptiGuide’s average problem-solving time was around 1.5 minutes,\\nmost of which was spent waiting for responses from the GPT-4 model. This indicates a 3x saving\\non the user’s time with AutoGen -based OptiGuide.\\nWhile using ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, users had to read through the code and instructions to\\nknow where to paste the code snippets. Additionally, running the code involves downloading it and\\nexecuting it in a terminal, a process that was both time-consuming and prone to errors. The response\\ntime from the Code Interpreter is also slower, as it generates lots of tokens to read the code, read the\\nvariables line-by-line, perform chains of thought analysis, and then produce the final answer code.\\nIn contrast, AutoGen integrates multiple agents to reduce user interactions by 3 - 5 times on average\\nas reported in Table 4, where we evaluated our system with 2000 questions across five OptiGuide\\napplications and measured how many prompts the user needs to type.\\nTable 4: Manual effort saved with OptiGuide (W/ GPT-4) while preserving the same coding perfor-\\nmance is shown in the data below.

ChatGPT+Code Interpreter is unable to run code with private pack-\\nages or customized dependencies (such as Gurobi); as a consequence, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nrequires users to have engineering expertise and to manually handle multiple steps, disrupting the\\nworkflow and increasing the chance for mistakes. If customers lack access or expertise, the bur-\\nden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time. In contrast, the automated chat by\\nAutoGen is more streamlined and autonomous, integrating multiple agents to solve problems and\\naddress concerns. This results in a 5x reduction in interaction and fundamentally changes the over-\\nall usability of the system. A stable workflow can be potentially reused for other applications or to\\ncompose a larger one.\\nTakeaways: The implementation of the multi-agent design with AutoGen in the OptiGuide appli-\\ncation offers several advantages. It simplifies the Python implementation and fosters a mixture of\\ncollaborative and adversarial problem-solving environments, with the Commander and Writer work-\\ning together while the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker.

Here,\\nthe board agent maintains the rules of the game and supports the players with information about the\\nboard. Players and the board agent all use natural language for communication.\\nIn Conversational Chess, each player is a AutoGen agent and can be powered either by a human or an\\nAI. A third party, known as the board agent, is designed to provide players with information about the\\nboard and ensure that players’ moves adhere to legal chess moves. Figure 14 illustrates the scenarios\\nsupported by Conversational Chess: AI/human vs. AI/human, and demonstrates how players and the\\nboard agent interact. This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves\\ncreatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games\\nmore entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational\\nchess).\\nTo realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options.\\nWhen human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human\\nplayer to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say\\n(such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the\\nmessage. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM\\nto parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then\\npushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error.\\nSubsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is\\nmade. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent.\\nAs shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When\\nthe player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message\\nfrom the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat\\nbetween one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps\\nkeep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.\\nThere are two notable benefits of using AutoGen to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the\\nagent design in AutoGen facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in\\nour chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat\\nmessages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly,\\nAutoGen greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition. Specifically,\\nwe utilized the register reply method supported by AutoGen agents to instantiate player agents\\nand a board agent with custom reply functions.

MiniWobChat consists of two agents: an assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant\\nagent suggests actions to manipulate the browser while the executor executes the suggested actions\\nand returns rewards/feedback. The assistant agent records the feedback and continues until the feed-\\nback indicates task success or failure.\\nIn practice, many applications require the presence of agents capable of interacting with environ-\\nments and making decisions in an online context, such as in game playing (Mnih et al., 2013; Vinyals\\net al., 2017), web interactions (Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017), and robot manipulations (Shen\\net al., 2021). With the multi-agent conversational framework in AutoGen , it becomes easy to de-\\ncompose the automatic agent-environment interactions and the development of a decision-making\\nagent by constructing an executor agent responsible for handling the interaction with the environ-\\nment, thereby delegating the decision-making part to other agents. Such a decomposition allows\\ndevelopers to reuse the decision-making agent for new tasks with minimal effort rather than build-\\ning a specialized decision-making agent for every new environment.\\nWorkflow. We demonstrate how to use AutoGen to build a working system for handling such\\nscenarios with the MiniWoB++ benchmark (Shi et al., 2017). MiniWoB++ comprises browser in-\\nteraction tasks that involve utilizing mouse and keyboard actions to interact with browsers. The\\nultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such\\nas “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires\\na sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at\\neach time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example\\nabove, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section.\\nWe designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using AutoGen , as shown in\\nFigure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in AssistantAgent and is responsible for\\nmaking action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized\\nUserProxyAgent , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions\\nsuggested by the AssistantAgent and returning feedback.\\nTo assess the performance of the developed working system, we compare it with RCI (Kim et al.,\\n2023), a recent solution for the MiniWoB++ benchmark that employs a set of self-critiquing prompts\\nand has achieved state-of-the-art performance. In our evaluation, we use all available tasks in the\\nofficial RCI code, with varying degrees of difficulty, to conduct a comprehensive analysis against\\nMiniWobChat. Figure 18 illustrates that MiniWobChat achieves competitive performance in this\\nevaluation8. Specifically, among the 49 available tasks, MiniWobChat achieves a success rate of\\n52.8%, which is only 3.6%lower than RCI, a method specifically designed for the MiniWob++\\nbenchmark. It is worth noting that in most tasks, the difference between the two methods is mirrored\\nas shown in Figure 18. If we consider 0.1 as a success rate tolerance for each task, i.e., two methods\\nthat differ within 0.1 are considered to have the same performance, both methods outperform the\\n8We report the results of RCI by running its official code with default settings.\\n32', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pablosal\\\\Desktop\\\\gbbai-azure-ai-search-indexing\\\\utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

(Right) They can form\\na chat, potentially with humans in the loop. (Bottom-middle) The framework supports flexible\\nconversation patterns.\\nAbstract\\nAutoGen2is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM ap-\\nplications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish\\ntasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable , and can operate in vari-\\nous modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using\\nAutoGen , developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both\\nnatural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation\\npatterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic framework for\\nbuilding diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Em-\\npirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example\\napplications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answer-\\ning, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.\\n1Corresponding author.

       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are becoming a crucial building block in developing powerful agents\\nthat utilize LLMs for reasoning, tool usage, and adapting to new observations (Yao et al., 2022; Xi\\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks. Given the expanding tasks that could\\nbenefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of\\nagents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help\\nencourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023),\\nand provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is\\nintriguing to ask the following question: how can we facilitate the development of LLM applications\\nthat could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?\\nOur insight is to use multi-agent conversations to achieve it. There are at least three reasons con-\\nfirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat-\\noptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate\\nthrough conversations with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea-\\nsoning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad\\nrange of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings),\\nconversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities\\nin a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex\\ntasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this\\npartitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and\\nsupport different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten-\\ntially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent\\nconversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil-\\nity to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions:\\n(1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in\\nmulti-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can\\naccommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying\\ncomplexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different\\nconversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and\\nstatic vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent\\ninteractions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would\\nlimit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.\\nWhile there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a\\ngeneralized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts.\\n1Customizable and conversable agents. AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-\\nage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can\\neasily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code,\\nwire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in\\ncapabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors.\\nTo make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made conversable –\\nthey can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold\\nmultiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer-\\ntain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the\\nstrong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat\\nand also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1)\\n2Conversation programming. A fundamental insight of AutoGen is to simplify and unify com-\\nplex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So AutoGen adopts a program-\\nming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as\\nconversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two\\nprimary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as\\ndescribed above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-\\ncentric computation andcontrol . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-\\ngramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent\\nbehaviors. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and\\nexperimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)\\n3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents\\nand conversation programming. These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support\\napplications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities. Moreover, we perform both\\nevaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications. The results show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,\\nwhile reducing development effort. (Section 3 and Appendix D)\\n2 The AutoGen Framework\\nTo reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-\\nmains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows\\nusing multi-agent conversations. This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-\\nmented agents. This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and\\nconversation programming.\\n2.1 Conversable Agents\\nInAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and\\nreceive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation. It\\nmaintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess\\na set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc. The agents can act according\\nto programmed behavior patterns described next.\\nAgent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools. Since an agent’s capabilities directly\\ninfluence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents\\nwith various capabilities. AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,\\nincluding 1) LLMs. LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role\\nplaying, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing\\nfeedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways\\nvia novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. AutoGen also offers\\nenhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,\\nvia an enhanced LLM inference layer. 2) Humans. Human involvement is desired or even essential\\nin many LLM applications. AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-\\nbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on\\nthe agent configuration. The default user proxy agent allows configurable human involvement levels\\nand patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for\\nhumans to skip providing input. 3) Tools. Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools\\nvia code execution or function execution. For example, the default user proxy agent in AutoGen is\\nable to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls.\\nAgent customization and cooperation. Based on application-specific needs, each agent can be\\nconfigured to have a mix of basic back-end types to display complex behavior in multi-agent con-\\nversations. AutoGen allows easy creation of agents with specialized capabilities and roles by reusing\\nor extending the built-in agents. The yellow-shaded area of Figure 2 provides a sketch of the built-in\\nagents in AutoGen . The ConversableAgent class is the highest-level agent abstraction and, by\\ndefault, can use LLMs, humans, and tools. The AssistantAgent andUserProxyAgent are two\\npre-configured ConversableAgent subclasses, each representing a common usage mode, i.e., act-\\ning as an AI assistant (backed by LLMs) and acting as a human proxy to solicit human input or\\nexecute code/function calls (backed by humans and/or tools).\\nIn the example on the right-hand side of Figure 1, an LLM-backed assistant agent and a tool- and\\nhuman-backed user proxy agent are deployed together to tackle a task. Here, the assistant agent\\ngenerates a solution with the help of LLMs and passes the solution to the user proxy agent. Then,\\nthe user proxy agent solicits human inputs or executes the assistant’s code and passes the results as\\nfeedback back to the assistant.\\n4Appendix C presents an example of such novel prompting techniques which empowers the default LLM-\\nbacked assistant agent in AutoGen to converse with other agents in multi-step problem solving.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The top sub-\\nfigure illustrates the built-in agents provided by AutoGen , which have unified conversation interfaces\\nand can be customized. The middle sub-figure shows an example of using AutoGen to develop\\na two-agent system with a custom reply function. The bottom sub-figure illustrates the resulting\\nautomated agent chat from the two-agent system during program execution.\\nBy allowing custom agents that can converse with each other, conversable agents in AutoGen serve\\nas a useful building block. However, to develop applications where agents make meaningful progress\\non tasks, developers also need to be able to specify and mold these multi-agent conversations.\\n2.2 Conversation Programming\\nAs a solution to the above problem, AutoGen utilizes conversation programming , a paradigm that\\nconsiders two concepts: the first is computation – the actions agents take to compute their response\\nin a multi-agent conversation. And the second is control flow – the sequence (or conditions) un-\\nder which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to\\nprogram these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In AutoGen , these\\ncomputations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is\\ninvolved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina-\\ntion condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’\\ndecisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the\\ninter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow\\nas agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.\\nFigure 2 provides a simple illustration. The bottom sub-figure shows how individual agents perform\\ntheir role-specific, conversation-centric computations to generate responses (e.g., via LLM inference\\ncalls and code execution). The task progresses through conversations displayed in the dialog box.\\nThe middle sub-figure demonstrates a conversation-based control flow. When the assistant receives\\na message, the user proxy agent typically sends the human input as a reply. If there is no input, it\\nexecutes any code in the assistant’s message instead.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen features the following design patterns to facilitate conversation programming:\\n1.Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat. Agents in\\nAutoGen have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation-\\ncentric computation, including a send/receive function for sending/receiving messages and a\\ngenerate reply function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received\\nmessage. AutoGen also introduces and by default adopts an agent auto-reply mechanism to\\nrealize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au-\\ntomatically invokes generate reply and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination\\ncondition is satisfied. AutoGen provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code\\nor function execution, or human input. One can also register custom reply functions to customize\\nthe behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender\\nagent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is\\ninitialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds\\nnaturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation\\nflow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”)\\nof Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation\\nwould proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Pro-\\ngram Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and\\nunified way to define the workflow.\\n2.Control by fusion of programming and natural language. AutoGen allows the usage of\\nprogramming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1) Natural-\\nlanguage control via LLMs. InAutoGen , one can control the conversation flow by prompting\\nthe LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the\\nbuilt-in AssistantAgent inAutoGen uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors\\nand generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent\\nto confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to\\nconsume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are\\ncompleted to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can\\nbe found in Appendix C. 2) Programming-language control. InAutoGen , Python code can be\\nused to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the\\nmax number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control\\nthe conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “Conversation-\\nDriven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3) Control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. AutoGen also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM\\ninference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from nat-\\nural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).\\nIn the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse\\npatterns. In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, AutoGen also supports dynamic\\nconversation flows with multiple agents. AutoGen provides two general ways to achieve this: 1)\\nCustomized generate reply function: within the customized generate reply function, one\\nagent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending\\non the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides\\nwhether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging\\nadditional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In\\naddition, AutoGen supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in GroupChatManager ,\\nwhich can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We\\nelaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems\\nto showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.\\n3 Applications of AutoGen\\nWe demonstrate six applications using AutoGen (see Figure 3) to illustrate its potential in simplify-\\ning the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected\\nbased on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-\\nities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6).

We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,\\nincluding open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-\\nAct (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and\\nChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize\\nthe results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and\\non the entire5test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-\\nready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including\\nthe commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process\\nwith the help of AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one only needs to set\\nhuman input mode=‘ALWAYS’ in the UserProxyAgent of the system in scenario 1. We demon-\\nstrate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that\\ncannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where\\nmultiple human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our\\nexperiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or\\nnew experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of\\nthe evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.\\nA2: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\\nRetrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic\\nlimitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this section, we employ AutoGen to\\nbuild a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system (Lewis et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2021)\\nnamed Retrieval-augmented Chat. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User\\nProxy agent and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, both of which are extended from built-in\\nagents from AutoGen . The Retrieval-augmented User Proxy includes a vector database (Chroma,\\n5We did not evaluate ChatGPT on the whole dataset since it requires substantial manual effort and is re-\\nstricted by its hourly message-number limitation.

A detailed\\nworkflow description of the Retrieval-augmented Chat is provided in Appendix D.\\nWe evaluate Retrieval-augmented Chat in both question-answering and code-generation scenarios.\\n(Scenario 1 ) We first perform an evaluation regarding natural question answering on the Natural\\nQuestions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and report results in Figure 4b. In this evaluation, we\\ncompare our system with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) following an existing evaluation6prac-\\ntice (Adlakha et al., 2023). Leveraging the conversational design and natural-language control,\\nAutoGen introduces a novel interactive retrieval feature in this application: whenever the retrieved\\ncontext does not contain the information, instead of terminating, the LLM-based assistant would\\nreply “ Sorry, I cannot find any information about... UPDATE CONTEXT. ” which will invoke more\\nretrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say “I\\ndon’t know” instead of “UPDATE CONTEXT. ” in cases where relevant information is not found,\\nand report results in Figure 4b. The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed\\nplays a non-trivial role in the process. We give a concrete example and results using this appealing\\nfeature in Appendix D. ( Scenario 2 ) We further demonstrate how Retrieval-augmented Chat aids in\\ngenerating code based on a given codebase that contains code not included in GPT-4’s training data.\\nEvaluation and demonstration details for both scenarios are included in Appendix D.\\n6The results of DPR with GPT-3.5 shown in Figure 4b are from (Adlakha et al., 2023).

       " Document(page_content='A3: Decision Making in Text World Environments\\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate how AutoGen can be used to develop effective applications that\\ninvolve interactive or online decision making. We perform the study using the ALFWorld (Shridhar\\net al., 2021) benchmark, which includes a diverse collection of synthetic language-based interactive\\ndecision-making tasks in household environments.\\nWith AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld. It consists of\\nan LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor\\nagent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates Re-\\nAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge\\nencountered in both ReAct and the AutoGen -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to\\nleverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the\\nsystem getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of AutoGen\\nallows us to address this issue effectively: With AutoGen , we are able to introduce a grounding\\nagent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as “You must find and take the object\\nbefore you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it. ” –whenever\\nthe system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to\\navoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants\\nof our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct7on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report\\nresults in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15%\\nperformance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding\\nagent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly miti-\\ngated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error\\nloops. For an example trajectory comparing the systems see Appendix D, Figure 10.\\nA4: Multi-Agent Coding\\nIn this subsection, we use AutoGen to build a multi-agent coding system based on OptiGuide (Li\\net al., 2023a), a system that excels at writing code to interpret optimization solutions and answer\\nuser questions, such as exploring the implications of changing a supply-chain decision or under-\\nstanding why the optimizer made a particular choice. The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the\\nAutoGen -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as\\n“What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2? ” to the Commander agent. The Com-\\nmander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer\\nthe question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the\\ncode, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will\\nuse external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution\\nresults. For instance, the writer may say “ if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the\\ntotal cost would increase by 10.5%. ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the\\nend user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the\\nCommander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information. The process might\\nbe repeated multiple times until the user’s question is answered or timed-out.\\nWith AutoGen the core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. We provide a detailed comparison of user expe-\\nrience with ChatGPT+Code Interpreter and AutoGen -based OptiGuide in Appendix D, where we\\nshow that AutoGen -based OptiGuide could save around 3x of user’s time and reduce user interac-\\ntions by 3 - 5 times on average. We also conduct an ablation showing that multi-agent abstraction is\\nnecessary. Specifically, we construct a single-agent approach where a single agent conducts both the\\ncode-writing and safeguard processes. We tested the single- and multi-agent approaches on a dataset\\nof 100 coding tasks, which is crafted to include equal numbers of safe and unsafe tasks. Evaluation\\nresults as reported in Figure 4d show that the multi-agent design boosts the F-1 score in identifying\\nunsafe code by 8% (with GPT-4) and 35% (with GPT-3.5-turbo).\\n7Results of ReAct are obtained by directly running its official code with default settings. The code uses\\ntext-davinci-003 as backend LM and does not support GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A5: Dynamic Group Chat\\nAutoGen provides native support for a dynamic group chat communication pattern, in which par-\\nticipating agents share the same context and converse with the others in a dynamic manner instead\\nof following a pre-defined order. Dynamic group chat relies on ongoing conversations to guide the\\nflow of interaction among agents. These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where col-\\nlaboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In AutoGen , the GroupChatManager\\nclass serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps:\\ndynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting\\nthe message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style\\nprompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared\\nto a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effec-\\ntive consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and\\nspeaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls.\\nWe include detailed results in Appendix D.\\nA6: Conversational Chess\\nUsing AutoGen , we developed Conversational Chess, a natural language interface game shown in\\nthe last sub-figure of Figure 3. It features built-in agents for players, which can be human or LLM,\\nand a third-party board agent to provide information and validate moves based on standard rules.\\nWith AutoGen , we enabled two essential features: (1) Natural, flexible, and engaging game dynam-\\nics, enabled by the customizable agent design in AutoGen . Conversational Chess supports a range\\nof game-play patterns, including AI-AI, AI-human, and human-human, with seamless switching\\nbetween these modes during a single game. An illustrative example of these entertaining game dy-\\nnamics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain\\ngame integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move\\nis invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move\\nbefore continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con-\\nsistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied\\non a relevant prompt “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves” to\\nground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused\\ngame disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board\\nagent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants. A comprehensive demon-\\nstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D.\\n4 Discussion\\nWe introduced an open-source library, AutoGen , that incorporates the paradigms of conversable\\nagents and conversation programming. This library utilizes capable agents that are well-suited for\\nmulti-agent cooperation. It features a unified conversation interface among the agents, along with\\nan auto-reply mechanisms, which help establish an agent-interaction interface that capitalizes on the\\nstrengths of chat-optimized LLMs with broad capabilities while accommodating a wide range of\\napplications. AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating and experimenting with multi-\\nagent systems that can easily fulfill various practical requirements, such as reusing, customizing,\\nand extending existing agents, as well as programming conversations between them.\\nOur experiments, as detailed in Section 3, demonstrate that this approach offers numerous benefits.\\nThe adoption of AutoGen has resulted in improved performance (over state-of-the-art approaches),\\nreduced development code, and decreased manual burden for existing applications. It offers flex-\\nibility to developers, as demonstrated in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, where AutoGen enables\\nmulti-agent chats to follow a dynamic pattern rather than fixed back-and-forth interactions. It allows\\nhumans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner. Despite the\\ncomplexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent\\ncooperation), the implementation based on AutoGen remains straightforward.

       " Document(page_content='Although this work is still in its early experimental stages, it paves the way for numerous future\\ndirections and research opportunities. For instance, we can explore effective integration of existing\\nagent implementations into our multi-agent framework and investigate the optimal balance between\\nautomation and human control in multi-agent workflows. As we further develop and refine AutoGen ,\\nwe aim to investigate which strategies, such as agent topology and conversation patterns, lead to the\\nmost effective multi-agent conversations while optimizing the overall efficiency, among other fac-\\ntors. While increasing the number of agents and other degrees of freedom presents opportunities for\\ntackling more complex problems, it may also introduce new safety challenges that require additional\\nstudies and careful consideration.\\nWe provide more discussion in Appendix B, including guidelines for using AutoGen and direction\\nof future work. We hope AutoGen will help improve many LLM applications in terms of speed of\\ndevelopment, ease of experimentation, and overall effectiveness and safety. We actively welcome\\ncontributions from the broader community.\\nEthics statement\\nThere are several potential ethical considerations that could arise from the development and use of\\ntheAutoGen framework.\\n• Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations\\nbetween agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that\\ndevelopers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy.\\n• Bias and Fairness: LLMs have been shown to exhibit biases present in their training data (Navigli\\net al., 2023). When using LLMs in the AutoGen framework, it is crucial to address and mitigate\\nany biases that may arise in the conversations between agents. Developers should be aware of\\npotential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity.\\n• Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in-\\nvolves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability\\nand transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making\\nprocess of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues\\nor biases.\\n• Trust and Reliance: AutoGen leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing\\nautomation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this\\ninteraction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user\\neducation about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019).\\n• Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa-\\ntion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. In particular, allowing LLM agents to\\nmake changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing\\npackages, could be risky. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that\\nappropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work presented in this report was made possible through discussions and feedback from Peter\\nLee, Johannes Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Steven Lucco, Umesh Madan, Robin Moeur, Piali Choud-\\nhury, Saleema Amershi, Adam Fourney, Victor Dibia, Guoqing Zheng, Corby Rosset, Ricky Loynd,\\nEce Kamar, Rafah Hosn, John Langford, Ida Momennejad, Brian Krabach, Taylor Webb, Shanka\\nSubhra Mondal, Wei-ge Chen, Robert Gruen, Yinan Li, Yue Wang, Suman Nath, Tanakorn Leesat-\\napornwongsa, Xin Wang, Shishir Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Saehan Jo, Ishai Menache, Kontantina Mel-\\nlou, Runlong Zhou, Feiran Jia, Hamed Khanpour, Hamid Palangi, Srinagesh Sharma, Julio Albinati\\nCortez, Amin Saied, Yuzhe Ma, Dujian Ding, Linyong Nan, Prateek Yadav, Shannon Shen, Ankur\\nMallick, Mark Encarnaci ´on, Lars Liden, Tianwei Yue, Julia Kiseleva, Anastasia Razdaibiedina, and\\nLuciano Del Corro.

       " Document(page_content='A Related Work\\nWe examine existing LLM-based agent systems or frameworks that can be used to build LLM appli-\\ncations. We categorize the related work into single-agent and multi-agent systems and specifically\\nprovide a summary of differentiators comparing AutoGen with existing multi-agent systems in Ta-\\nble 1. Note that many of these systems are evolving open-source projects, so the remarks and\\nstatements about them may only be accurate as of the time of writing. We refer interested readers to\\ndetailed LLM-based agent surveys (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b)\\nSingle-Agent Systems:\\n•AutoGPT : AutoGPT is an open-source implementation of an AI agent that attempts to au-\\ntonomously achieve a given goal (AutoGPT, 2023). It follows a single-agent paradigm in which\\nit augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration.\\n•ChatGPT+ (with code interpreter or plugin) : ChatGPT, a conversational AI service or agent,\\ncan now be used alongside a code interpreter or plugin (currently available only under the pre-\\nmium subscription plan ChatGPT Plus) (OpenAI, 2023). The code interpreter enables ChatGPT\\nto execute code, while the plugin enhances ChatGPT with a wide range of curated tools.\\n•LangChain Agents : LangChain is a general framework for developing LLM-based applica-\\ntions (LangChain, 2023). LangChain Agents is a subpackage for using an LLM to choose a\\nsequence of actions. There are various types of agents in LangChain Agents, with the ReAct agent\\nbeing a notable example that combines reasoning and acting when using LLMs (mainly designed\\nfor LLMs prior to ChatGPT) (Yao et al., 2022). All agents provided in LangChain Agents fol-\\nlow a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative\\nmodes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these lim-\\nitations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not\\nbased on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain\\nlies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped\\nby LangChain and the corresponding interface.\\n•Transformers Agent : Transformers Agent (HuggingFace, 2023) is an experimental natural-\\nlanguage API built on the transformers repository. It includes a set of curated tools and an agent\\nto interpret natural language and use these tools. Similar to AutoGPT, it follows a single-agent\\nparadigm and does not support agent collaboration.\\nAutoGen differs from the single-agent systems above by supporting multi-agent LLM applications.\\nMulti-Agent Systems:\\n•BabyAGI : BabyAGI (BabyAGI, 2023) is an example implementation of an AI-powered task man-\\nagement system in a Python script. In this implemented system, multiple LLM-based agents\\nare used. For example, there is an agent for creating new tasks based on the objective and the\\nresult of the previous task, an agent for prioritizing the task list, and an agent for completing\\ntasks/sub-tasks. As a multi-agent system, BabyAGI adopts a static agent conversation pattern,\\ni.e., a predefined order of agent communication, while AutoGen supports both static and dynamic\\nconversation patterns and additionally supports tool usage and human involvement.\\n•CAMEL : CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b) is a communicative agent framework. It demonstrates\\nhow role playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task comple-\\ntion. It also records agent conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. An\\nInception-prompting technique is used to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. Un-\\nlikeAutoGen , CAMEL does not natively support tool usage, such as code execution. Although it\\nis proposed as an infrastructure for multi-agent conversation, it only supports static conversation\\npatterns, while AutoGen additionally supports dynamic conversation patterns.\\n•Multi-Agent Debate: Two recent works investigate and show that multi-agent debate is an effec-\\ntive way to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs (Liang et al., 2023) and to improve the factuality\\nand reasoning of LLMs (Du et al., 2023). In both works, multiple LLM inference instances are\\nconstructed as multiple agents to solve problems with agent debate. Each agent is simply an LLM\\ninference instance, while no tool or human is involved, and the inter-agent conversation needs\\nto follow a pre-defined order. These works attempt to build LLM applications with multi-agent\\nconversation, while AutoGen , designed as a generic infrastructure, can be used to facilitate this\\ndevelopment and enable more applications with dynamic conversation patterns.\\n14', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='•MetaGPT : MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023) is a specialized LLM application based on a multi-agent\\nconversation framework for automatic software development. They assign different roles to GPTs\\nto collaboratively develop software. They differ from AutoGen by being specialized solutions to\\na certain scenario, while AutoGen is a generic infrastructure to facilitate building applications for\\nvarious scenarios.\\nThere are a few other specialized single-agent or multi-agent systems, such as V oyager (Wang et al.,\\n2023a) and Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), which we skip due to lower relevance.

       " Document(page_content='B Expanded Discussion\\nThe applications in Section 3 show how AutoGen not only enables new applications but also helps\\nrenovate existing ones. For example, in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, AutoGen enabled the cre-\\nation of multi-agent conversations that follow a dynamic pattern instead of a fixed back-and-forth.\\nAnd in both A5 and A6, humans can participate in the activities together with multiple other AI\\nagents in a conversational manner. Similarly, A1-A4 show how popular applications can be reno-\\nvated quickly with AutoGen . Despite the complexity of these applications (most of them involve\\nmore than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent cooperation), our AutoGen -based implementa-\\ntion remains simple, demonstrating promising opportunities to build creative applications and a large\\nspace for innovation. In reflecting on why these benefits can be achieved in these applications with\\nAutoGen , we believe there are a few reasons:\\n•Ease of use : The built-in agents can be used out-of-the-box, delivering strong performance even\\nwithout any customization. (A1, A3)\\n•Modularity : The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each\\nagent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall develop-\\nment process and facilitating code management. (A3, A4, A5, and A6)\\n•Programmability: AutoGen allows users to extend/customize existing agents to develop systems\\nsatisfying their specific needs with ease. (A1-A6). For example, with AutoGen , the core workflow\\ncode in A4 is reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines, for a 4x saving.\\n•Allowing human involvement :AutoGen provides a native mechanism to achieve human partici-\\npation and/or human oversight. With AutoGen , humans can seamlessly and optionally cooperate\\nwith AIs to solve problems or generally participate in the activity. AutoGen also facilitates inter-\\nactive user instructions to ensure the process stays on the desired path. (A1, A2, A5, and A6)\\n•Collaborative/adversarial agent interactions : Like many collaborative agent systems (Dong\\net al., 2023), agents in AutoGen can share information and knowledge, to complement each other’s\\nabilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. (A1, A2, A3, and A4). Analogously, in certain\\nscenarios, some agents are required to work in an adversarial way. Relevant information is shared\\namong different conversations in a controlled manner, preventing distraction or hallucination. (A4,\\nA6). AutoGen supports both patterns, enabling effective utilization and augmentation of LLMs.\\nB.1 General Guidelines for Using AutoGen\\nBelow we give some recommendations for using agents in AutoGen to accomplish a task.\\n1.Consider using built-in agents first. For example, AssistantAgent is pre-configured to be\\nbacked by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via\\ncode. The UserProxyAgent is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution.\\nMany problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents\\nfor an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition,\\ncode execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an\\nagent; (2) AutoGen supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective\\nway to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3) UserProxyAgent\\ncan be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys-\\ntem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its\\nconversation flow with natural language.\\n2.Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat\\nsetup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can\\nbe easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a\\ndynamic way.\\n3. Try to reuse built-in reply methods based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a\\ncustom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way\\n(e.g., the built-in agent GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply\\nfunction when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3).\\n4. When developing a new application with UserProxyAgent ,start with humans always in\\nthe loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au-\\ntonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis-\\ncovering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting\\n16', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='human input mode = ‘NEVER’. This enables LLM as a backend, and one can either use the\\nLLM or manually generate diverse system messages to simulate different use cases.\\n5. Despite the numerous advantages of AutoGen agents, there could be cases/scenarios where other\\nlibraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements\\nfor back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and-\\nforth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023),\\nLlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023),\\nGorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM\\ninference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are\\nhelpful, one can use them as tool backends for AutoGen agents. For example, one can readily use\\ntools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in AutoGen agent. (3) For specific applications, one\\nmay want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could\\nwrap those agents as conversable agents in AutoGen and then use them to build LLM applications\\nthrough multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among\\nmany tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages\\nlike ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with AutoGen to automate such tuning.\\nB.2 Future Work\\nThis work raises many research questions and future directions and .\\nDesigning optimal multi-agent workflows: Creating a multi-agent workflow for a given task can\\ninvolve many decisions, e.g., how many agents to include, how to assign agent roles and agent\\ncapabilities, how the agents should interact with each other, and whether to automate a particular\\npart of the workflow. There may not exist a one-fits-all answer, and the best solution might depend\\non the specific application. This raises important questions: For what types of tasks and applications\\nare multi-agent workflows most useful? How do multiple agents help in different applications? For\\na given task, what is the optimal (e.g., cost-effective) multi-agent workflow?\\nCreating highly capable agents: AutoGen can enable the development of highly capable agents\\nthat leverage the strengths of LLMs, tools, and humans. Creating such agents is crucial to ensuring\\nthat a multi-agent workflow can effectively troubleshoot and make progress on a task. For example,\\nwe observed that CAMEL, another multi-agent LLM system, cannot effectively solve problems in\\nmost cases primarily because it lacks the capability to execute tools or code. This failure shows that\\nLLMs and multi-agent conversations with simple role playing are insufficient, and highly capable\\nagents with diverse skill sets are essential. We believe that more systematic work will be required to\\ndevelop guidelines for application-specific agents, to create a large OSS knowledge base of agents,\\nand to create agents that can discover and upgrade their skills (Cai et al., 2023).\\nEnabling scale, safety, and human agency: Section 3 shows how complex multi-agent workflows\\ncan enable new applications, and future work will be needed to assess whether scaling further can\\nhelp solve extremely complex tasks. However, as these workflows scale and grow more complex,\\nit may become difficult to log and adjust them. Thus, it will become essential to develop clear\\nmechanisms and tools to track and debug their behavior. Otherwise, these techniques risk resulting\\nin incomprehensible, unintelligible chatter among agents (Lewis et al., 2017).\\nOur work also shows how complex, fully autonomous workflows with AutoGen can be useful, but\\nfully autonomous agent conversations will need to be used with care. While the autonomous mode\\nAutoGen supports could be desirable in many scenarios, a high level of autonomy can also pose\\npotential risks, especially in high-risk applications (Amodei et al., 2016; Weld & Etzioni, 1994). As\\na result, building fail-safes against cascading failures and exploitation, mitigating reward hacking,\\nout of control and undesired behaviors, maintaining effective human oversight of applications built\\nwith AutoGen agents will become important. While AutoGen provides convenient and seamless\\ninvolvement of humans through a user proxy agent, developers and stakeholders still need to under-\\nstand and determine the appropriate level and pattern of human involvement to ensure the safe and\\nethical use of the technology (Horvitz, 1999; Amershi et al., 2019).\\n17', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don’t use a code block if it’s not intended to be executed by the user.If you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don’t include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use ’print’ function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can’t be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

The results indicate that they are not suitable choices for solving\\nmath problems out of the box. For instance, when MetaGPT is tasked with solving a math problem,\\nit begins developing software to address the problem, but most of the time, it does not actually solve\\nthe problem.

For the quantitative evaluation, we conduct two sets of experiments on\\nthe MATH dataset to assess the correctness of these systems: (1) an experiment involving 120\\nlevel-5 (the most challenging level) problems, including 20 problems from six categories, excluding\\ngeometry, and (2) an experiment on the entire test set, which includes 5000 problems. We exclude\\nAutoGPT from this evaluation as it cannot access results from code executions and does not solve\\nany problems in the qualitative evaluation. Our analysis of the entire dataset reveals that AutoGen\\nachieves an overall accuracy of 69.48%, while GPT-4’s accuracy stands at 55.18%. From these\\nevaluations, we have the following observations regarding the problem-solving success rate and\\nuser experience of these systems:\\n• Problem-solving success rate: Results from the quantitative evaluations show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve the highest problem-solving success rate among all the compared methods. The qual-\\nitative evaluations elucidate common failure reasons across several alternative approaches. Chat-\\nGPT+Code Interpreter fails to solve the second problem, and ChatGPT+Plugin struggles to solve\\nboth problems. AutoGPT fails on both problems due to code execution issues. The LangChain\\nagent also fails on both problems, producing code that results in incorrect answers in all trials.\\n• Based on the qualitative evaluation, we analyze the user experience concerning the verbosity of\\nthe response and the ability of the LLM-based system to run without unexpected behaviors. Chat-\\nGPT+Plugin is the least verbose, mainly because Wolfram queries are much shorter than Python\\ncode. AutoGen , ChatGPT+Code Interpreter, and LangChain exhibit similar verbosity, although\\nLangChain is slightly more verbose due to more code execution errors. AutoGPT is the most\\nverbose system owing to predefined steps like THOUGHTS, REASONING, and PLAN, which it\\nincludes in replies every time. Overall, AutoGen and ChatGPT+Code Interpreter operate smoothly\\nwithout exceptions. We note the occurrences of undesired behaviors from other LLM-based sys-\\ntems that could affect user experience: AutoGPT consistently outputs code without the print’\\nstatement and cannot correct this, requiring the user to run them manually; ChatGPT with Wol-\\nfram Alpha plugin has the potential to become stuck in a loop that must be manually stopped; and\\nLangchain ReAct could exit with a parse error, necessitating the passing of a ‘handle parse error’\\nparameter.\\nEnable Multi-User Problem Solving ViaStudent        and Expert Student Proxy\\nStudentAssistant\\nExpertAssistant\\nExpert Proxy\\nAsk for expert\\nEnable Autonomous and Human-in-the-loop Problem Solving\\nFigure 6: Examples of three settings utilized to solve math problems using AutoGen : (Gray) En-\\nables a workflow where a student collaborates with an assistant agent to solve problems, either\\nautonomously or in a human-in-the-loop mode.

       " Document(page_content='helpful. To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one can set human input mode=‘ALWAYS’\\nin the user proxy agent. We select one challenging problem that none of these systems can solve\\nautonomously across three trials. We adhere to the process outlined below to provide human inputs\\nfor all the compared methods:\\n1. Input the problem: Find the equation of the plane which bisects the angle\\nbetween the planes 3x−6y+ 2z+ 5 = 0 and4x−12y+ 3z−3 = 0 ,and which\\ncontains the point (−5,−1,−5).Enter your answer in the form\\nAx+By+Cz+D= 0,\\nwhere A, B, C, D are integers such that A > 0and\\ngcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.\\n2. The response from the system does not solve the problem correctly. We then give a\\nhint to the model: Your idea is not correct. Let’s solve this together.\\nSuppose P= (x, y, z )is a point that lies on a plane that bisects the\\nangle, the distance from P to the two planes is the same. Please\\nset up this equation first.\\n3. We expect the system to give the correct distance equation. Since the equation involves\\nan absolute sign that is hard to solve, we would give the next hint: Consider the two\\ncases to remove the abs sign and get two possible solutions.\\n4. If the system returns the two possible solutions and doesn’t continue to the next step, we\\ngive the last hint: Use point (-5,-1,-5) to determine which is correct and\\ngive the final answer.\\n5. Final answer is 11x+6y+5z+86=0 .\\nWe observed that AutoGen consistently solved the problem across all three trials. ChatGPT+Code\\nInterpreter and ChatGPT+Plugin managed to solve the problem in two out of three trials, while Au-\\ntoGPT failed to solve it in all three attempts. In its unsuccessful attempt, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nfailed to adhere to human hints. In its failed trial, ChatGPT+Plugin produced an almost correct solu-\\ntion but had a sign discrepancy in the final answer. AutoGPT was unable to yield a correct solution\\nin any of the trials. In one trial, it derived an incorrect distance equation. In the other two trials, the\\nfinal answer was incorrect due to code execution errors.\\nScenario 3: Multi-User Problem Solving. Next-generation LLM applications may necessitate\\nthe involvement of multiple real users for collectively solving a problem with the assistance of\\nLLMs. We showcase how AutoGen can be leveraged to effortlessly construct such a system. Specif-\\nically, building upon scenario 2 mentioned above, we aim to devise a simple system involving two\\nhuman users: a student and an expert. In this setup, the student interacts with an LLM assistant to\\naddress some problems, and the LLM automatically resorts to the expert when necessary.\\nThe overall workflow is as follows: The student chats with the LLM-based assistant agent through\\na student proxy agent to solve problems. When the assistant cannot solve the problem satisfactorily,\\nor the solution does not match the expectation of the student, it would automatically hold the con-\\nversation and call the pre-defined askforexpert function via the function callfeature of GPT\\nin order to resort to the expert. Specifically, it would automatically produce the initial message for\\ntheaskforexpert function, which could be the statement of the problem or the request to verify\\nthe solution to a problem, and the expert is supposed to respond to this message with the help of\\nthe expert assistant. After the conversation between the expert and the expert’s assistant, the final\\nmessage would be sent back to the student assistant as the response to the initial message. Then, the\\nstudent assistant would resume the conversation with the student using the response from the expert\\nfor a better solution. A detailed visualization is shown in Figure 6.\\nWith AutoGen , constructing the student/expert proxy agent and the assistant agents is straight-\\nforward by reusing the built-in UserProxyAgent andAssistantAgent through appropriate\\nconfigurations. The only development required involves writing several lines of code for the\\naskforexpert function, which then becomes part of the configuration for the assistant. Ad-\\nditionally, it’s easy to extend such a system to include more than one expert, with a specific\\naskforexpert function for each, or to include multiple student users with a shared expert for\\nconsultation.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Given a set of documents, the\\nRetrieval-augmented User Proxy first automatically processes documents—splits, chunks, and stores\\nthem in a vector database. Then for a given user input, it retrieves relevant chunks as context and\\nsends it to the Retrieval-augmented Assistant, which uses LLM to generate code or text to answer\\nquestions. Agents converse until they find a satisfactory answer.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow of Retrieval-Augmented Chat is illustrated in Figure 7. To\\nuse Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\\n1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding simi-\\nlarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based\\non the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it\\nis instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\\n3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and\\nsends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it\\nterminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along\\nwith the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation\\nis enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n4. If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar\\nchunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it\\ngenerates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate\\nan answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times.\\nThe conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.\\nWe utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat in two scenarios. The first scenario aids in generating code\\nbased on a given codebase. While LLMs possess strong coding abilities, they are unable to utilize\\npackages or APIs that are not included in their training data, e.g., private codebases, or have trouble\\nusing trained ones that are frequently updated post-training. Hence, Retrieval-Augmented Code\\nGeneration is considered to be highly valuable. The second scenario involves question-answering\\non the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), enabling us to obtain comparative\\nevaluation metrics for the performance of our system.\\nScenario 1: Evaluation on Natural Questions QA dataset. In this case, we evaluate the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Chat’s end-to-end question-answering performance using the Natural Ques-\\ntions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). We collected 5,332 non-redundant context documents and\\n6,775 queries from HuggingFace. First, we create a document collection based on the entire context\\ncorpus and store it in the vector database. Then, we utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat to answer the\\nquestions.

Specifically, we utilize a straightforward vector search\\nretriever with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for embeddings.\\nFurthermore, we analyze the number of LLM calls in experiments involving both AutoGen and\\nAutoGen W/O interactive retrieval , revealing that approximately 19.4% of questions in the Natural\\nQuestions dataset trigger an “Update Context” operation, resulting in additional LLM calls.\\nScenario 2: Code Generation Leveraging Latest APIs from the Codebase.

Consequently, the original GPT-4 model is unable to generate the\\ncorrect code, due to its lack of knowledge regarding Spark-related APIs. Instead, it erroneously cre-\\nates a non-existent parameter, spark , and sets it to True’. Nevertheless, with Retrieval-Augmented\\nChat, we provide the latest reference documents as context.

We propose two designs: a two-agent design where the assistant\\nagent suggests the next step, and the Executor executes actions and provides feedback. The three-\\nagent design adds a grounding agent that supplies commonsense facts to the executor when needed.\\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a synthetic language-based interactive decision-making task.\\nIt comprises textual environments that aim to simulate real-world household scenes. Given a high-\\nlevel goal (e.g., putting a hot apple in the fridge) and the description of the household environment,\\nthe agent needs to explore and interact with the simulated household environment through a textual\\ninterface. A typical task environment contains various types of locations and could require more\\nthan 40 steps to finish, which highlights the need for agents to decompose the goal into subtasks and\\ntackle them one by one, while effectively exploring the environments.\\nDetailed Workflow. We first propose a straightforward two-agent system with AutoGen , illustrated\\non the left-hand side of Figure 9, to tackle tasks from this benchmark. The system consists of\\nan assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant agent generates plans and makes action\\ndecisions to solve the tasks. The executor agent is tailored specifically for ALFWorld. It performs\\nactions proposed by the assistant and reports action execution results in the household environment\\nas feedback to the assistant. Due to the strict format requirements for the output format, we use the\\nBLEU metric to evaluate the similarity of the output to all valid action options. The option with the\\nhighest similarity will be chosen as the action for this round.\\nOne major challenge encompassed in ALFWorld is commonsense reasoning. The agent needs to\\nextract patterns from the few-shot examples provided and combine them with the agent’s general\\nknowledge of household environments to fully understand task rules. More often than not, the as-\\nsistant tends to neglect some basic knowledge of the household environment. Thanks to the easy-to-\\nimplement multi-agent conversational feature of AutoGen , enhancing the assistant agent’s reason-\\ning ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making\\nagent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the\\nreasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the\\nassistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the\\ntask begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the\\nassistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in\\noutputting the same content or constantly apologizing.\\nWe compare our system’s performance with ReAct, which treats ALFWorld as a text-completion\\ntask. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) is a few-shot prompting technique that interleaves reasoning and\\nacting, allowing for greater synergy between the two and significantly improving performance on\\nboth language and decision-making tasks. We integrate ReAct into AutoGen by modifying the\\nprompts in a conversational manner. Following ReAct, we employ a two-shot setting.

If issues arise, the process can repeat until resolved. Shaded circles\\nrepresent steps that may be repeated multiple times.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow can be described as follows. The end user initiates the in-\\nteraction by posing a question, such as “What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery\\n2?”, marked by\\n1 to the Commander agent. The Commander manages and coordinates with two\\nLLM-based assistant agents: the Writer and the Safeguard. Apart from directing the flow of commu-\\nnication, the Commander has the responsibility of handling memory tied to user interactions. This\\ncapability enables the Commander to capture and retain valuable context regarding the user’s ques-\\ntions and their corresponding responses. Such memory is subsequently shared across the system,\\nempowering the other agents with context from prior user interactions and ensuring more informed\\nand relevant responses.\\nIn this orchestrated process, the Writer, who combines the functions of a “Coder” and an “Inter-\\npreter” as defined in (Li et al., 2023a), will craft code and also interpret execution output logs. For in-\\nstance, during code writing (\\n2 and\\n3 ), the Writer may craft code “model.addConstr(x[‘supplier1’,\\n‘roastery2’] == 0, ‘prohibit’)” to add an additional constraint to answer the user’s question.\\nAfter receiving the code, the Commander will communicate with the Safeguard to screen the code\\nand ascertain its safety (\\n4 ); once the code obtains the Safeguard’s clearance, marked by\\n5 , the\\nCommander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code and request the Writer to\\ninterpret the execution results for the user’s question (\\n6 and\\n7 ). For instance, the writer may\\nsay “if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%.”\\nBringing this intricate process full circle, the Commander furnishes the user with the concluding\\nanswer (\\n8 ).\\nIf at a point there is an exception - either a security red flag raised by Safeguard (in\\n5 ) or code\\nexecution failures within Commander, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with\\nessential information in logs (\\n6 ). So, the process from\\n3 to\\n6 might be repeated multiple times,\\nuntil each user query receives a thorough and satisfactory resolution or until the timeout. This entire\\ncomplex workflow of multi-agent interaction is elegantly managed via AutoGen .\\nThe core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines using AutoGen ,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. The new agents are customizable, conversable, and\\ncan autonomously manage their chat memories. This consolidation allows the coder and interpreter\\nroles to merge into a single “Writer” agent, resulting in a clean, concise, and intuitive implementation\\nthat is easier to maintain.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Manual Evaluation Comparing ChatGPT + Code Interpreter and AutoGen -based OptiGuide.\\nChatGPT + Code Interpreter is unable to execute code with private or customized dependencies (e.g.,\\nGurobi), which means users need to have engineering expertise to manually handle multiple steps,\\ndisrupting the workflow and increasing the chance for mistakes. If users lack access or expertise,\\nthe burden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time.\\nWe carried out a user study that juxtaposed OpenAI’s ChatGPT coupled with a Code Interpreter\\nagainst AutoGen -based OptiGuide. The study focused on a coffee supply chain scenario, and an\\nexpert Python programmer with proficiency in Gurobi participated in the test. We evaluated both\\nsystems based on 10 randomly selected questions, measuring time and accuracy. While both sys-\\ntems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide\\nbecause the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes\\nand 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approxi-\\nmately 2.5 minutes. In contrast, OptiGuide’s average problem-solving time was around 1.5 minutes,\\nmost of which was spent waiting for responses from the GPT-4 model. This indicates a 3x saving\\non the user’s time with AutoGen -based OptiGuide.\\nWhile using ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, users had to read through the code and instructions to\\nknow where to paste the code snippets. Additionally, running the code involves downloading it and\\nexecuting it in a terminal, a process that was both time-consuming and prone to errors. The response\\ntime from the Code Interpreter is also slower, as it generates lots of tokens to read the code, read the\\nvariables line-by-line, perform chains of thought analysis, and then produce the final answer code.\\nIn contrast, AutoGen integrates multiple agents to reduce user interactions by 3 - 5 times on average\\nas reported in Table 4, where we evaluated our system with 2000 questions across five OptiGuide\\napplications and measured how many prompts the user needs to type.\\nTable 4: Manual effort saved with OptiGuide (W/ GPT-4) while preserving the same coding perfor-\\nmance is shown in the data below.

ChatGPT+Code Interpreter is unable to run code with private pack-\\nages or customized dependencies (such as Gurobi); as a consequence, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nrequires users to have engineering expertise and to manually handle multiple steps, disrupting the\\nworkflow and increasing the chance for mistakes. If customers lack access or expertise, the bur-\\nden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time. In contrast, the automated chat by\\nAutoGen is more streamlined and autonomous, integrating multiple agents to solve problems and\\naddress concerns. This results in a 5x reduction in interaction and fundamentally changes the over-\\nall usability of the system. A stable workflow can be potentially reused for other applications or to\\ncompose a larger one.\\nTakeaways: The implementation of the multi-agent design with AutoGen in the OptiGuide appli-\\ncation offers several advantages. It simplifies the Python implementation and fosters a mixture of\\ncollaborative and adversarial problem-solving environments, with the Commander and Writer work-\\ning together while the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker. This setup allows for proper\\nmemory management, as the Commander maintains memory related to user interactions, provid-\\ning context-aware decision-making.

Here,\\nthe board agent maintains the rules of the game and supports the players with information about the\\nboard. Players and the board agent all use natural language for communication.\\nIn Conversational Chess, each player is a AutoGen agent and can be powered either by a human or an\\nAI. A third party, known as the board agent, is designed to provide players with information about the\\nboard and ensure that players’ moves adhere to legal chess moves. Figure 14 illustrates the scenarios\\nsupported by Conversational Chess: AI/human vs. AI/human, and demonstrates how players and the\\nboard agent interact. This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves\\ncreatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games\\nmore entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational\\nchess).\\nTo realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options.\\nWhen human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human\\nplayer to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say\\n(such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the\\nmessage. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM\\nto parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then\\npushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error.\\nSubsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is\\nmade. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent.\\nAs shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When\\nthe player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message\\nfrom the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat\\nbetween one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps\\nkeep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.\\nThere are two notable benefits of using AutoGen to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the\\nagent design in AutoGen facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in\\nour chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat\\nmessages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly,\\nAutoGen greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition. Specifically,\\nwe utilized the register reply method supported by AutoGen agents to instantiate player agents\\nand a board agent with custom reply functions. Concentrating the extension work needed at a single\\npoint (the reply function) simplifies the reasoning processes, and development and maintenance\\neffort.\\n30', metadata={'source': 'utils\\\\data\\\\autogen.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

MiniWobChat consists of two agents: an assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant\\nagent suggests actions to manipulate the browser while the executor executes the suggested actions\\nand returns rewards/feedback. The assistant agent records the feedback and continues until the feed-\\nback indicates task success or failure.\\nIn practice, many applications require the presence of agents capable of interacting with environ-\\nments and making decisions in an online context, such as in game playing (Mnih et al., 2013; Vinyals\\net al., 2017), web interactions (Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017), and robot manipulations (Shen\\net al., 2021). With the multi-agent conversational framework in AutoGen , it becomes easy to de-\\ncompose the automatic agent-environment interactions and the development of a decision-making\\nagent by constructing an executor agent responsible for handling the interaction with the environ-\\nment, thereby delegating the decision-making part to other agents. Such a decomposition allows\\ndevelopers to reuse the decision-making agent for new tasks with minimal effort rather than build-\\ning a specialized decision-making agent for every new environment.\\nWorkflow. We demonstrate how to use AutoGen to build a working system for handling such\\nscenarios with the MiniWoB++ benchmark (Shi et al., 2017). MiniWoB++ comprises browser in-\\nteraction tasks that involve utilizing mouse and keyboard actions to interact with browsers. The\\nultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such\\nas “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires\\na sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at\\neach time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example\\nabove, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section.\\nWe designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using AutoGen , as shown in\\nFigure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in AssistantAgent and is responsible for\\nmaking action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized\\nUserProxyAgent , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions\\nsuggested by the AssistantAgent and returning feedback.\\nTo assess the performance of the developed working system, we compare it with RCI (Kim et al.,\\n2023), a recent solution for the MiniWoB++ benchmark that employs a set of self-critiquing prompts\\nand has achieved state-of-the-art performance. In our evaluation, we use all available tasks in the\\nofficial RCI code, with varying degrees of difficulty, to conduct a comprehensive analysis against\\nMiniWobChat.

       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are becoming a crucial building block in developing powerful agents\\nthat utilize LLMs for reasoning, tool usage, and adapting to new observations (Yao et al., 2022; Xi\\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks. Given the expanding tasks that could\\nbenefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of\\nagents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help\\nencourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023),\\nand provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is\\nintriguing to ask the following question: how can we facilitate the development of LLM applications\\nthat could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?\\nOur insight is to use multi-agent conversations to achieve it. There are at least three reasons con-\\nfirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat-\\noptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate\\nthrough conversations with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea-\\nsoning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad\\nrange of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings),\\nconversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities\\nin a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex\\ntasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this\\npartitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and\\nsupport different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten-\\ntially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent\\nconversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil-\\nity to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions:\\n(1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in\\nmulti-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can\\naccommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying\\ncomplexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different\\nconversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and\\nstatic vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent\\ninteractions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would\\nlimit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.\\nWhile there is contemporaneous exploration of multi-agent approaches,3we present AutoGen , a\\ngeneralized multi-agent conversation framework (Figure 1), based on the following new concepts.\\n1Customizable and conversable agents. AutoGen uses a generic design of agents that can lever-\\nage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can\\neasily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code,\\nwire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in\\ncapabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors.\\nTo make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made conversable –\\nthey can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold\\nmultiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer-\\ntain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the\\nstrong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat\\nand also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1)\\n2Conversation programming. A fundamental insight of AutoGen is to simplify and unify com-\\nplex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So AutoGen adopts a program-\\nming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as\\nconversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two\\nprimary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as\\ndescribed above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation-\\ncentric computation andcontrol . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro-\\ngramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent\\nbehaviors. AutoGen provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and\\nexperimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)\\n3We refer to Appendix A for a detailed discussion.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen also provides a collection of multi-agent applications created using conversable agents\\nand conversation programming. These applications demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support\\napplications of various complexities and LLMs of various capabilities. Moreover, we perform both\\nevaluation on benchmarks and a pilot study of new applications. The results show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve outstanding performance on many tasks, and enable innovative ways of using LLMs,\\nwhile reducing development effort. (Section 3 and Appendix D)\\n2 The AutoGen Framework\\nTo reduce the effort required for developers to create complex LLM applications across various do-\\nmains, a core design principle of AutoGen is to streamline and consolidate multi-agent workflows\\nusing multi-agent conversations. This approach also aims to maximize the reusability of imple-\\nmented agents. This section introduces the two key concepts of AutoGen : conversable agents and\\nconversation programming.\\n2.1 Conversable Agents\\nInAutoGen , aconversable agent is an entity with a specific role that can pass messages to send and\\nreceive information to and from other conversable agents, e.g., to start or continue a conversation. It\\nmaintains its internal context based on sent and received messages and can be configured to possess\\na set of capabilities, e.g., enabled by LLMs, tools, or human input, etc. The agents can act according\\nto programmed behavior patterns described next.\\nAgent capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, and tools. Since an agent’s capabilities directly\\ninfluence how it processes and responds to messages, AutoGen allows flexibility to endow its agents\\nwith various capabilities. AutoGen supports many common composable capabilities for agents,\\nincluding 1) LLMs. LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role\\nplaying, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing\\nfeedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways\\nvia novel prompting techniques4to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. AutoGen also offers\\nenhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc.,\\nvia an enhanced LLM inference layer. 2) Humans. Human involvement is desired or even essential\\nin many LLM applications. AutoGen lets a human participate in agent conversation via human-\\nbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on\\nthe agent configuration. The default user proxy agent allows configurable human involvement levels\\nand patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for\\nhumans to skip providing input. 3) Tools. Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools\\nvia code execution or function execution. For example, the default user proxy agent in AutoGen is\\nable to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls.\\nAgent customization and cooperation. Based on application-specific needs, each agent can be\\nconfigured to have a mix of basic back-end types to display complex behavior in multi-agent con-\\nversations. AutoGen allows easy creation of agents with specialized capabilities and roles by reusing\\nor extending the built-in agents. The yellow-shaded area of Figure 2 provides a sketch of the built-in\\nagents in AutoGen . The ConversableAgent class is the highest-level agent abstraction and, by\\ndefault, can use LLMs, humans, and tools. The AssistantAgent andUserProxyAgent are two\\npre-configured ConversableAgent subclasses, each representing a common usage mode, i.e., act-\\ning as an AI assistant (backed by LLMs) and acting as a human proxy to solicit human input or\\nexecute code/function calls (backed by humans and/or tools).\\nIn the example on the right-hand side of Figure 1, an LLM-backed assistant agent and a tool- and\\nhuman-backed user proxy agent are deployed together to tackle a task. Here, the assistant agent\\ngenerates a solution with the help of LLMs and passes the solution to the user proxy agent. Then,\\nthe user proxy agent solicits human inputs or executes the assistant’s code and passes the results as\\nfeedback back to the assistant.\\n4Appendix C presents an example of such novel prompting techniques which empowers the default LLM-\\nbacked assistant agent in AutoGen to converse with other agents in multi-step problem solving.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The top sub-\\nfigure illustrates the built-in agents provided by AutoGen , which have unified conversation interfaces\\nand can be customized. The middle sub-figure shows an example of using AutoGen to develop\\na two-agent system with a custom reply function. The bottom sub-figure illustrates the resulting\\nautomated agent chat from the two-agent system during program execution.\\nBy allowing custom agents that can converse with each other, conversable agents in AutoGen serve\\nas a useful building block. However, to develop applications where agents make meaningful progress\\non tasks, developers also need to be able to specify and mold these multi-agent conversations.\\n2.2 Conversation Programming\\nAs a solution to the above problem, AutoGen utilizes conversation programming , a paradigm that\\nconsiders two concepts: the first is computation – the actions agents take to compute their response\\nin a multi-agent conversation. And the second is control flow – the sequence (or conditions) un-\\nder which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to\\nprogram these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In AutoGen , these\\ncomputations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is\\ninvolved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina-\\ntion condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’\\ndecisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the\\ninter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow\\nas agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.\\nFigure 2 provides a simple illustration. The bottom sub-figure shows how individual agents perform\\ntheir role-specific, conversation-centric computations to generate responses (e.g., via LLM inference\\ncalls and code execution). The task progresses through conversations displayed in the dialog box.\\nThe middle sub-figure demonstrates a conversation-based control flow. When the assistant receives\\na message, the user proxy agent typically sends the human input as a reply. If there is no input, it\\nexecutes any code in the assistant’s message instead.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AutoGen features the following design patterns to facilitate conversation programming:\\n1.Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat. Agents in\\nAutoGen have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation-\\ncentric computation, including a send/receive function for sending/receiving messages and a\\ngenerate reply function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received\\nmessage. AutoGen also introduces and by default adopts an agent auto-reply mechanism to\\nrealize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au-\\ntomatically invokes generate reply and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination\\ncondition is satisfied. AutoGen provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code\\nor function execution, or human input. One can also register custom reply functions to customize\\nthe behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender\\nagent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is\\ninitialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds\\nnaturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation\\nflow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”)\\nof Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation\\nwould proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Pro-\\ngram Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and\\nunified way to define the workflow.\\n2.Control by fusion of programming and natural language. AutoGen allows the usage of\\nprogramming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1) Natural-\\nlanguage control via LLMs. InAutoGen , one can control the conversation flow by prompting\\nthe LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the\\nbuilt-in AssistantAgent inAutoGen uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors\\nand generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent\\nto confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to\\nconsume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are\\ncompleted to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can\\nbe found in Appendix C. 2) Programming-language control. InAutoGen , Python code can be\\nused to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the\\nmax number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control\\nthe conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “Conversation-\\nDriven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3) Control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. AutoGen also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming\\nlanguage. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM\\ninference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from nat-\\nural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).\\nIn the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse\\npatterns. In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, AutoGen also supports dynamic\\nconversation flows with multiple agents. AutoGen provides two general ways to achieve this: 1)\\nCustomized generate reply function: within the customized generate reply function, one\\nagent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending\\non the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides\\nwhether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging\\nadditional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In\\naddition, AutoGen supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in GroupChatManager ,\\nwhich can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We\\nelaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems\\nto showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.\\n3 Applications of AutoGen\\nWe demonstrate six applications using AutoGen (see Figure 3) to illustrate its potential in simplify-\\ning the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected\\nbased on their real-world relevance (A1, A2, A4, A5, A6), problem difficulty and solving capabil-\\nities enabled by AutoGen (A1, A2, A3, A4), and innovative potential (A5, A6). Together, these\\ncriteria showcase AutoGen ’s role in advancing the LLM-application landscape.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches,\\nincluding open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re-\\nAct (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and\\nChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize\\nthe results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and\\non the entire5test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from AutoGen al-\\nready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including\\nthe commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process\\nwith the help of AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with AutoGen , one only needs to set\\nhuman input mode=‘ALWAYS’ in the UserProxyAgent of the system in scenario 1. We demon-\\nstrate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that\\ncannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where\\nmultiple human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our\\nexperiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or\\nnew experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of\\nthe evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.\\nA2: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\\nRetrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic\\nlimitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this section, we employ AutoGen to\\nbuild a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system (Lewis et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2021)\\nnamed Retrieval-augmented Chat. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User\\nProxy agent and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, both of which are extended from built-in\\nagents from AutoGen .

A detailed\\nworkflow description of the Retrieval-augmented Chat is provided in Appendix D.\\nWe evaluate Retrieval-augmented Chat in both question-answering and code-generation scenarios.\\n(Scenario 1 ) We first perform an evaluation regarding natural question answering on the Natural\\nQuestions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and report results in Figure 4b. In this evaluation, we\\ncompare our system with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) following an existing evaluation6prac-\\ntice (Adlakha et al., 2023). Leveraging the conversational design and natural-language control,\\nAutoGen introduces a novel interactive retrieval feature in this application: whenever the retrieved\\ncontext does not contain the information, instead of terminating, the LLM-based assistant would\\nreply “ Sorry, I cannot find any information about... UPDATE CONTEXT. ” which will invoke more\\nretrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say “I\\ndon’t know” instead of “UPDATE CONTEXT. ” in cases where relevant information is not found,\\nand report results in Figure 4b. The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed\\nplays a non-trivial role in the process. We give a concrete example and results using this appealing\\nfeature in Appendix D. ( Scenario 2 ) We further demonstrate how Retrieval-augmented Chat aids in\\ngenerating code based on a given codebase that contains code not included in GPT-4’s training data.\\nEvaluation and demonstration details for both scenarios are included in Appendix D.\\n6The results of DPR with GPT-3.5 shown in Figure 4b are from (Adlakha et al., 2023). We use GPT-3.5 as\\na shorthand for GPT-3.5-turbo.\\n7', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A3: Decision Making in Text World Environments\\nIn this subsection, we demonstrate how AutoGen can be used to develop effective applications that\\ninvolve interactive or online decision making. We perform the study using the ALFWorld (Shridhar\\net al., 2021) benchmark, which includes a diverse collection of synthetic language-based interactive\\ndecision-making tasks in household environments.\\nWith AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld. It consists of\\nan LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor\\nagent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates Re-\\nAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge\\nencountered in both ReAct and the AutoGen -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to\\nleverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the\\nsystem getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of AutoGen\\nallows us to address this issue effectively: With AutoGen , we are able to introduce a grounding\\nagent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as “You must find and take the object\\nbefore you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it. ” –whenever\\nthe system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to\\navoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants\\nof our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct7on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report\\nresults in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15%\\nperformance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding\\nagent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly miti-\\ngated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error\\nloops. For an example trajectory comparing the systems see Appendix D, Figure 10.\\nA4: Multi-Agent Coding\\nIn this subsection, we use AutoGen to build a multi-agent coding system based on OptiGuide (Li\\net al., 2023a), a system that excels at writing code to interpret optimization solutions and answer\\nuser questions, such as exploring the implications of changing a supply-chain decision or under-\\nstanding why the optimizer made a particular choice. The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the\\nAutoGen -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as\\n“What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2? ” to the Commander agent. The Com-\\nmander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer\\nthe question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the\\ncode, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will\\nuse external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution\\nresults. For instance, the writer may say “ if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the\\ntotal cost would increase by 10.5%. ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the\\nend user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the\\nCommander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information. The process might\\nbe repeated multiple times until the user’s question is answered or timed-out.\\nWith AutoGen the core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. We provide a detailed comparison of user expe-\\nrience with ChatGPT+Code Interpreter and AutoGen -based OptiGuide in Appendix D, where we\\nshow that AutoGen -based OptiGuide could save around 3x of user’s time and reduce user interac-\\ntions by 3 - 5 times on average. We also conduct an ablation showing that multi-agent abstraction is\\nnecessary. Specifically, we construct a single-agent approach where a single agent conducts both the\\ncode-writing and safeguard processes. We tested the single- and multi-agent approaches on a dataset\\nof 100 coding tasks, which is crafted to include equal numbers of safe and unsafe tasks. Evaluation\\nresults as reported in Figure 4d show that the multi-agent design boosts the F-1 score in identifying\\nunsafe code by 8% (with GPT-4) and 35% (with GPT-3.5-turbo).\\n7Results of ReAct are obtained by directly running its official code with default settings. The code uses\\ntext-davinci-003 as backend LM and does not support GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A5: Dynamic Group Chat\\nAutoGen provides native support for a dynamic group chat communication pattern, in which par-\\nticipating agents share the same context and converse with the others in a dynamic manner instead\\nof following a pre-defined order. Dynamic group chat relies on ongoing conversations to guide the\\nflow of interaction among agents. These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where col-\\nlaboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In AutoGen , the GroupChatManager\\nclass serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps:\\ndynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting\\nthe message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style\\nprompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared\\nto a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effec-\\ntive consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and\\nspeaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls.\\nWe include detailed results in Appendix D.\\nA6: Conversational Chess\\nUsing AutoGen , we developed Conversational Chess, a natural language interface game shown in\\nthe last sub-figure of Figure 3. It features built-in agents for players, which can be human or LLM,\\nand a third-party board agent to provide information and validate moves based on standard rules.\\nWith AutoGen , we enabled two essential features: (1) Natural, flexible, and engaging game dynam-\\nics, enabled by the customizable agent design in AutoGen . Conversational Chess supports a range\\nof game-play patterns, including AI-AI, AI-human, and human-human, with seamless switching\\nbetween these modes during a single game. An illustrative example of these entertaining game dy-\\nnamics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain\\ngame integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move\\nis invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move\\nbefore continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con-\\nsistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied\\non a relevant prompt “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves” to\\nground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused\\ngame disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board\\nagent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants. A comprehensive demon-\\nstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D.\\n4 Discussion\\nWe introduced an open-source library, AutoGen , that incorporates the paradigms of conversable\\nagents and conversation programming. This library utilizes capable agents that are well-suited for\\nmulti-agent cooperation. It features a unified conversation interface among the agents, along with\\nan auto-reply mechanisms, which help establish an agent-interaction interface that capitalizes on the\\nstrengths of chat-optimized LLMs with broad capabilities while accommodating a wide range of\\napplications. AutoGen serves as a general framework for creating and experimenting with multi-\\nagent systems that can easily fulfill various practical requirements, such as reusing, customizing,\\nand extending existing agents, as well as programming conversations between them.\\nOur experiments, as detailed in Section 3, demonstrate that this approach offers numerous benefits.\\nThe adoption of AutoGen has resulted in improved performance (over state-of-the-art approaches),\\nreduced development code, and decreased manual burden for existing applications. It offers flex-\\nibility to developers, as demonstrated in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, where AutoGen enables\\nmulti-agent chats to follow a dynamic pattern rather than fixed back-and-forth interactions. It allows\\nhumans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner. Despite the\\ncomplexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent\\ncooperation), the implementation based on AutoGen remains straightforward. Dividing tasks among\\nseparate agents promotes modularity. Furthermore, since each agent can be developed, tested, and\\nmaintained separately, this approach simplifies overall development and code management.\\n9', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Although this work is still in its early experimental stages, it paves the way for numerous future\\ndirections and research opportunities. For instance, we can explore effective integration of existing\\nagent implementations into our multi-agent framework and investigate the optimal balance between\\nautomation and human control in multi-agent workflows. As we further develop and refine AutoGen ,\\nwe aim to investigate which strategies, such as agent topology and conversation patterns, lead to the\\nmost effective multi-agent conversations while optimizing the overall efficiency, among other fac-\\ntors. While increasing the number of agents and other degrees of freedom presents opportunities for\\ntackling more complex problems, it may also introduce new safety challenges that require additional\\nstudies and careful consideration.\\nWe provide more discussion in Appendix B, including guidelines for using AutoGen and direction\\nof future work. We hope AutoGen will help improve many LLM applications in terms of speed of\\ndevelopment, ease of experimentation, and overall effectiveness and safety. We actively welcome\\ncontributions from the broader community.\\nEthics statement\\nThere are several potential ethical considerations that could arise from the development and use of\\ntheAutoGen framework.\\n• Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations\\nbetween agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that\\ndevelopers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy.\\n• Bias and Fairness: LLMs have been shown to exhibit biases present in their training data (Navigli\\net al., 2023). When using LLMs in the AutoGen framework, it is crucial to address and mitigate\\nany biases that may arise in the conversations between agents. Developers should be aware of\\npotential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity.\\n• Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in-\\nvolves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability\\nand transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making\\nprocess of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues\\nor biases.\\n• Trust and Reliance: AutoGen leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing\\nautomation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this\\ninteraction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user\\neducation about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019).\\n• Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa-\\ntion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. In particular, allowing LLM agents to\\nmake changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing\\npackages, could be risky. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that\\nappropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work presented in this report was made possible through discussions and feedback from Peter\\nLee, Johannes Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Steven Lucco, Umesh Madan, Robin Moeur, Piali Choud-\\nhury, Saleema Amershi, Adam Fourney, Victor Dibia, Guoqing Zheng, Corby Rosset, Ricky Loynd,\\nEce Kamar, Rafah Hosn, John Langford, Ida Momennejad, Brian Krabach, Taylor Webb, Shanka\\nSubhra Mondal, Wei-ge Chen, Robert Gruen, Yinan Li, Yue Wang, Suman Nath, Tanakorn Leesat-\\napornwongsa, Xin Wang, Shishir Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Saehan Jo, Ishai Menache, Kontantina Mel-\\nlou, Runlong Zhou, Feiran Jia, Hamed Khanpour, Hamid Palangi, Srinagesh Sharma, Julio Albinati\\nCortez, Amin Saied, Yuzhe Ma, Dujian Ding, Linyong Nan, Prateek Yadav, Shannon Shen, Ankur\\nMallick, Mark Encarnaci ´on, Lars Liden, Tianwei Yue, Julia Kiseleva, Anastasia Razdaibiedina, and\\nLuciano Del Corro.

       " Document(page_content='A Related Work\\nWe examine existing LLM-based agent systems or frameworks that can be used to build LLM appli-\\ncations. We categorize the related work into single-agent and multi-agent systems and specifically\\nprovide a summary of differentiators comparing AutoGen with existing multi-agent systems in Ta-\\nble 1. Note that many of these systems are evolving open-source projects, so the remarks and\\nstatements about them may only be accurate as of the time of writing. We refer interested readers to\\ndetailed LLM-based agent surveys (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b)\\nSingle-Agent Systems:\\n•AutoGPT : AutoGPT is an open-source implementation of an AI agent that attempts to au-\\ntonomously achieve a given goal (AutoGPT, 2023). It follows a single-agent paradigm in which\\nit augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration.\\n•ChatGPT+ (with code interpreter or plugin) : ChatGPT, a conversational AI service or agent,\\ncan now be used alongside a code interpreter or plugin (currently available only under the pre-\\nmium subscription plan ChatGPT Plus) (OpenAI, 2023). The code interpreter enables ChatGPT\\nto execute code, while the plugin enhances ChatGPT with a wide range of curated tools.\\n•LangChain Agents : LangChain is a general framework for developing LLM-based applica-\\ntions (LangChain, 2023). LangChain Agents is a subpackage for using an LLM to choose a\\nsequence of actions. There are various types of agents in LangChain Agents, with the ReAct agent\\nbeing a notable example that combines reasoning and acting when using LLMs (mainly designed\\nfor LLMs prior to ChatGPT) (Yao et al., 2022). All agents provided in LangChain Agents fol-\\nlow a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative\\nmodes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these lim-\\nitations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not\\nbased on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain\\nlies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped\\nby LangChain and the corresponding interface.\\n•Transformers Agent : Transformers Agent (HuggingFace, 2023) is an experimental natural-\\nlanguage API built on the transformers repository. It includes a set of curated tools and an agent\\nto interpret natural language and use these tools. Similar to AutoGPT, it follows a single-agent\\nparadigm and does not support agent collaboration.\\nAutoGen differs from the single-agent systems above by supporting multi-agent LLM applications.\\nMulti-Agent Systems:\\n•BabyAGI : BabyAGI (BabyAGI, 2023) is an example implementation of an AI-powered task man-\\nagement system in a Python script. In this implemented system, multiple LLM-based agents\\nare used. For example, there is an agent for creating new tasks based on the objective and the\\nresult of the previous task, an agent for prioritizing the task list, and an agent for completing\\ntasks/sub-tasks. As a multi-agent system, BabyAGI adopts a static agent conversation pattern,\\ni.e., a predefined order of agent communication, while AutoGen supports both static and dynamic\\nconversation patterns and additionally supports tool usage and human involvement.\\n•CAMEL : CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b) is a communicative agent framework. It demonstrates\\nhow role playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task comple-\\ntion. It also records agent conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. An\\nInception-prompting technique is used to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. Un-\\nlikeAutoGen , CAMEL does not natively support tool usage, such as code execution. Although it\\nis proposed as an infrastructure for multi-agent conversation, it only supports static conversation\\npatterns, while AutoGen additionally supports dynamic conversation patterns.\\n•Multi-Agent Debate: Two recent works investigate and show that multi-agent debate is an effec-\\ntive way to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs (Liang et al., 2023) and to improve the factuality\\nand reasoning of LLMs (Du et al., 2023). In both works, multiple LLM inference instances are\\nconstructed as multiple agents to solve problems with agent debate. Each agent is simply an LLM\\ninference instance, while no tool or human is involved, and the inter-agent conversation needs\\nto follow a pre-defined order. These works attempt to build LLM applications with multi-agent\\nconversation, while AutoGen , designed as a generic infrastructure, can be used to facilitate this\\ndevelopment and enable more applications with dynamic conversation patterns.\\n14', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='B Expanded Discussion\\nThe applications in Section 3 show how AutoGen not only enables new applications but also helps\\nrenovate existing ones. For example, in A1 (scenario 3), A5, and A6, AutoGen enabled the cre-\\nation of multi-agent conversations that follow a dynamic pattern instead of a fixed back-and-forth.\\nAnd in both A5 and A6, humans can participate in the activities together with multiple other AI\\nagents in a conversational manner. Similarly, A1-A4 show how popular applications can be reno-\\nvated quickly with AutoGen . Despite the complexity of these applications (most of them involve\\nmore than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent cooperation), our AutoGen -based implementa-\\ntion remains simple, demonstrating promising opportunities to build creative applications and a large\\nspace for innovation. In reflecting on why these benefits can be achieved in these applications with\\nAutoGen , we believe there are a few reasons:\\n•Ease of use : The built-in agents can be used out-of-the-box, delivering strong performance even\\nwithout any customization. (A1, A3)\\n•Modularity : The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each\\nagent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall develop-\\nment process and facilitating code management. (A3, A4, A5, and A6)\\n•Programmability: AutoGen allows users to extend/customize existing agents to develop systems\\nsatisfying their specific needs with ease. (A1-A6). For example, with AutoGen , the core workflow\\ncode in A4 is reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines, for a 4x saving.\\n•Allowing human involvement :AutoGen provides a native mechanism to achieve human partici-\\npation and/or human oversight. With AutoGen , humans can seamlessly and optionally cooperate\\nwith AIs to solve problems or generally participate in the activity. AutoGen also facilitates inter-\\nactive user instructions to ensure the process stays on the desired path. (A1, A2, A5, and A6)\\n•Collaborative/adversarial agent interactions : Like many collaborative agent systems (Dong\\net al., 2023), agents in AutoGen can share information and knowledge, to complement each other’s\\nabilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. (A1, A2, A3, and A4). Analogously, in certain\\nscenarios, some agents are required to work in an adversarial way. Relevant information is shared\\namong different conversations in a controlled manner, preventing distraction or hallucination. (A4,\\nA6). AutoGen supports both patterns, enabling effective utilization and augmentation of LLMs.\\nB.1 General Guidelines for Using AutoGen\\nBelow we give some recommendations for using agents in AutoGen to accomplish a task.\\n1.Consider using built-in agents first. For example, AssistantAgent is pre-configured to be\\nbacked by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via\\ncode. The UserProxyAgent is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution.\\nMany problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents\\nfor an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition,\\ncode execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an\\nagent; (2) AutoGen supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective\\nway to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3) UserProxyAgent\\ncan be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys-\\ntem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its\\nconversation flow with natural language.\\n2.Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat\\nsetup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can\\nbe easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a\\ndynamic way.\\n3. Try to reuse built-in reply methods based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a\\ncustom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way\\n(e.g., the built-in agent GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply\\nfunction when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3).\\n4. When developing a new application with UserProxyAgent ,start with humans always in\\nthe loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au-\\ntonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis-\\ncovering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting\\n16', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='human input mode = ‘NEVER’. This enables LLM as a backend, and one can either use the\\nLLM or manually generate diverse system messages to simulate different use cases.\\n5. Despite the numerous advantages of AutoGen agents, there could be cases/scenarios where other\\nlibraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements\\nfor back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and-\\nforth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023),\\nLlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023),\\nGorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM\\ninference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are\\nhelpful, one can use them as tool backends for AutoGen agents. For example, one can readily use\\ntools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in AutoGen agent. (3) For specific applications, one\\nmay want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could\\nwrap those agents as conversable agents in AutoGen and then use them to build LLM applications\\nthrough multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among\\nmany tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages\\nlike ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with AutoGen to automate such tuning.\\nB.2 Future Work\\nThis work raises many research questions and future directions and .\\nDesigning optimal multi-agent workflows: Creating a multi-agent workflow for a given task can\\ninvolve many decisions, e.g., how many agents to include, how to assign agent roles and agent\\ncapabilities, how the agents should interact with each other, and whether to automate a particular\\npart of the workflow. There may not exist a one-fits-all answer, and the best solution might depend\\non the specific application. This raises important questions: For what types of tasks and applications\\nare multi-agent workflows most useful? How do multiple agents help in different applications? For\\na given task, what is the optimal (e.g., cost-effective) multi-agent workflow?\\nCreating highly capable agents: AutoGen can enable the development of highly capable agents\\nthat leverage the strengths of LLMs, tools, and humans. Creating such agents is crucial to ensuring\\nthat a multi-agent workflow can effectively troubleshoot and make progress on a task. For example,\\nwe observed that CAMEL, another multi-agent LLM system, cannot effectively solve problems in\\nmost cases primarily because it lacks the capability to execute tools or code. This failure shows that\\nLLMs and multi-agent conversations with simple role playing are insufficient, and highly capable\\nagents with diverse skill sets are essential. We believe that more systematic work will be required to\\ndevelop guidelines for application-specific agents, to create a large OSS knowledge base of agents,\\nand to create agents that can discover and upgrade their skills (Cai et al., 2023).\\nEnabling scale, safety, and human agency: Section 3 shows how complex multi-agent workflows\\ncan enable new applications, and future work will be needed to assess whether scaling further can\\nhelp solve extremely complex tasks. However, as these workflows scale and grow more complex,\\nit may become difficult to log and adjust them. Thus, it will become essential to develop clear\\nmechanisms and tools to track and debug their behavior. Otherwise, these techniques risk resulting\\nin incomprehensible, unintelligible chatter among agents (Lewis et al., 2017).\\nOur work also shows how complex, fully autonomous workflows with AutoGen can be useful, but\\nfully autonomous agent conversations will need to be used with care. While the autonomous mode\\nAutoGen supports could be desirable in many scenarios, a high level of autonomy can also pose\\npotential risks, especially in high-risk applications (Amodei et al., 2016; Weld & Etzioni, 1994). As\\na result, building fail-safes against cascading failures and exploitation, mitigating reward hacking,\\nout of control and undesired behaviors, maintaining effective human oversight of applications built\\nwith AutoGen agents will become important. While AutoGen provides convenient and seamless\\ninvolvement of humans through a user proxy agent, developers and stakeholders still need to under-\\nstand and determine the appropriate level and pattern of human involvement to ensure the safe and\\nethical use of the technology (Horvitz, 1999; Amershi et al., 2019).\\n17', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

We exclude\\nAutoGPT from this evaluation as it cannot access results from code executions and does not solve\\nany problems in the qualitative evaluation. Our analysis of the entire dataset reveals that AutoGen\\nachieves an overall accuracy of 69.48%, while GPT-4’s accuracy stands at 55.18%. From these\\nevaluations, we have the following observations regarding the problem-solving success rate and\\nuser experience of these systems:\\n• Problem-solving success rate: Results from the quantitative evaluations show that AutoGen can\\nhelp achieve the highest problem-solving success rate among all the compared methods. The qual-\\nitative evaluations elucidate common failure reasons across several alternative approaches. Chat-\\nGPT+Code Interpreter fails to solve the second problem, and ChatGPT+Plugin struggles to solve\\nboth problems. AutoGPT fails on both problems due to code execution issues. The LangChain\\nagent also fails on both problems, producing code that results in incorrect answers in all trials.\\n• Based on the qualitative evaluation, we analyze the user experience concerning the verbosity of\\nthe response and the ability of the LLM-based system to run without unexpected behaviors. Chat-\\nGPT+Plugin is the least verbose, mainly because Wolfram queries are much shorter than Python\\ncode. AutoGen , ChatGPT+Code Interpreter, and LangChain exhibit similar verbosity, although\\nLangChain is slightly more verbose due to more code execution errors. AutoGPT is the most\\nverbose system owing to predefined steps like THOUGHTS, REASONING, and PLAN, which it\\nincludes in replies every time. Overall, AutoGen and ChatGPT+Code Interpreter operate smoothly\\nwithout exceptions. We note the occurrences of undesired behaviors from other LLM-based sys-\\ntems that could affect user experience: AutoGPT consistently outputs code without the print’\\nstatement and cannot correct this, requiring the user to run them manually; ChatGPT with Wol-\\nfram Alpha plugin has the potential to become stuck in a loop that must be manually stopped; and\\nLangchain ReAct could exit with a parse error, necessitating the passing of a ‘handle parse error’\\nparameter.\\nEnable Multi-User Problem Solving ViaStudent        and Expert Student Proxy\\nStudentAssistant\\nExpertAssistant\\nExpert Proxy\\nAsk for expert\\nEnable Autonomous and Human-in-the-loop Problem Solving\\nFigure 6: Examples of three settings utilized to solve math problems using AutoGen : (Gray) En-\\nables a workflow where a student collaborates with an assistant agent to solve problems, either\\nautonomously or in a human-in-the-loop mode.

We adhere to the process outlined below to provide human inputs\\nfor all the compared methods:\\n1. Input the problem: Find the equation of the plane which bisects the angle\\nbetween the planes 3x−6y+ 2z+ 5 = 0 and4x−12y+ 3z−3 = 0 ,and which\\ncontains the point (−5,−1,−5).Enter your answer in the form\\nAx+By+Cz+D= 0,\\nwhere A, B, C, D are integers such that A > 0and\\ngcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.\\n2.

Let’s solve this together.\\nSuppose P= (x, y, z )is a point that lies on a plane that bisects the\\nangle, the distance from P to the two planes is the same. Please\\nset up this equation first.\\n3. We expect the system to give the correct distance equation. Since the equation involves\\nan absolute sign that is hard to solve, we would give the next hint: Consider the two\\ncases to remove the abs sign and get two possible solutions.\\n4. If the system returns the two possible solutions and doesn’t continue to the next step, we\\ngive the last hint: Use point (-5,-1,-5) to determine which is correct and\\ngive the final answer.\\n5.

ChatGPT+Code\\nInterpreter and ChatGPT+Plugin managed to solve the problem in two out of three trials, while Au-\\ntoGPT failed to solve it in all three attempts. In its unsuccessful attempt, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nfailed to adhere to human hints. In its failed trial, ChatGPT+Plugin produced an almost correct solu-\\ntion but had a sign discrepancy in the final answer. AutoGPT was unable to yield a correct solution\\nin any of the trials. In one trial, it derived an incorrect distance equation. In the other two trials, the\\nfinal answer was incorrect due to code execution errors.\\nScenario 3: Multi-User Problem Solving. Next-generation LLM applications may necessitate\\nthe involvement of multiple real users for collectively solving a problem with the assistance of\\nLLMs. We showcase how AutoGen can be leveraged to effortlessly construct such a system. Specif-\\nically, building upon scenario 2 mentioned above, we aim to devise a simple system involving two\\nhuman users: a student and an expert. In this setup, the student interacts with an LLM assistant to\\naddress some problems, and the LLM automatically resorts to the expert when necessary.\\nThe overall workflow is as follows: The student chats with the LLM-based assistant agent through\\na student proxy agent to solve problems. When the assistant cannot solve the problem satisfactorily,\\nor the solution does not match the expectation of the student, it would automatically hold the con-\\nversation and call the pre-defined askforexpert function via the function callfeature of GPT\\nin order to resort to the expert. Specifically, it would automatically produce the initial message for\\ntheaskforexpert function, which could be the statement of the problem or the request to verify\\nthe solution to a problem, and the expert is supposed to respond to this message with the help of\\nthe expert assistant. After the conversation between the expert and the expert’s assistant, the final\\nmessage would be sent back to the student assistant as the response to the initial message. Then, the\\nstudent assistant would resume the conversation with the student using the response from the expert\\nfor a better solution. A detailed visualization is shown in Figure 6.\\nWith AutoGen , constructing the student/expert proxy agent and the assistant agents is straight-\\nforward by reusing the built-in UserProxyAgent andAssistantAgent through appropriate\\nconfigurations. The only development required involves writing several lines of code for the\\naskforexpert function, which then becomes part of the configuration for the assistant. Ad-\\nditionally, it’s easy to extend such a system to include more than one expert, with a specific\\naskforexpert function for each, or to include multiple student users with a shared expert for\\nconsultation.\\n21', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

Given a set of documents, the\\nRetrieval-augmented User Proxy first automatically processes documents—splits, chunks, and stores\\nthem in a vector database. Then for a given user input, it retrieves relevant chunks as context and\\nsends it to the Retrieval-augmented Assistant, which uses LLM to generate code or text to answer\\nquestions. Agents converse until they find a satisfactory answer.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow of Retrieval-Augmented Chat is illustrated in Figure 7. To\\nuse Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\\n1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding simi-\\nlarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based\\non the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it\\nis instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\\n3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and\\nsends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it\\nterminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along\\nwith the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation\\nis enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n4. If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar\\nchunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it\\ngenerates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate\\nan answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times.\\nThe conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.\\nWe utilize Retrieval-Augmented Chat in two scenarios. The first scenario aids in generating code\\nbased on a given codebase. While LLMs possess strong coding abilities, they are unable to utilize\\npackages or APIs that are not included in their training data, e.g., private codebases, or have trouble\\nusing trained ones that are frequently updated post-training. Hence, Retrieval-Augmented Code\\nGeneration is considered to be highly valuable. The second scenario involves question-answering\\non the Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), enabling us to obtain comparative\\nevaluation metrics for the performance of our system.\\nScenario 1: Evaluation on Natural Questions QA dataset. In this case, we evaluate the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Chat’s end-to-end question-answering performance using the Natural Ques-\\ntions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019).

Consequently, the original GPT-4 model is unable to generate the\\ncorrect code, due to its lack of knowledge regarding Spark-related APIs. Instead, it erroneously cre-\\nates a non-existent parameter, spark , and sets it to True’. Nevertheless, with Retrieval-Augmented\\nChat, we provide the latest reference documents as context.

We propose two designs: a two-agent design where the assistant\\nagent suggests the next step, and the Executor executes actions and provides feedback. The three-\\nagent design adds a grounding agent that supplies commonsense facts to the executor when needed.\\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) is a synthetic language-based interactive decision-making task.\\nIt comprises textual environments that aim to simulate real-world household scenes. Given a high-\\nlevel goal (e.g., putting a hot apple in the fridge) and the description of the household environment,\\nthe agent needs to explore and interact with the simulated household environment through a textual\\ninterface. A typical task environment contains various types of locations and could require more\\nthan 40 steps to finish, which highlights the need for agents to decompose the goal into subtasks and\\ntackle them one by one, while effectively exploring the environments.\\nDetailed Workflow. We first propose a straightforward two-agent system with AutoGen , illustrated\\non the left-hand side of Figure 9, to tackle tasks from this benchmark. The system consists of\\nan assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant agent generates plans and makes action\\ndecisions to solve the tasks. The executor agent is tailored specifically for ALFWorld. It performs\\nactions proposed by the assistant and reports action execution results in the household environment\\nas feedback to the assistant. Due to the strict format requirements for the output format, we use the\\nBLEU metric to evaluate the similarity of the output to all valid action options. The option with the\\nhighest similarity will be chosen as the action for this round.\\nOne major challenge encompassed in ALFWorld is commonsense reasoning. The agent needs to\\nextract patterns from the few-shot examples provided and combine them with the agent’s general\\nknowledge of household environments to fully understand task rules. More often than not, the as-\\nsistant tends to neglect some basic knowledge of the household environment. Thanks to the easy-to-\\nimplement multi-agent conversational feature of AutoGen , enhancing the assistant agent’s reason-\\ning ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making\\nagent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the\\nreasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the\\nassistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the\\ntask begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the\\nassistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in\\noutputting the same content or constantly apologizing.\\nWe compare our system’s performance with ReAct, which treats ALFWorld as a text-completion\\ntask. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) is a few-shot prompting technique that interleaves reasoning and\\nacting, allowing for greater synergy between the two and significantly improving performance on\\nboth language and decision-making tasks. We integrate ReAct into AutoGen by modifying the\\nprompts in a conversational manner. Following ReAct, we employ a two-shot setting. The few-\\nshot prompts are obtained from the corresponding repository. As shown in Table 3, the two-agent\\n24', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

The Writer crafts the code and inter-\\npretation, the Safeguard ensures safety (e.g., not leaking information, no malicious code), and the\\nCommander executes the code. If issues arise, the process can repeat until resolved. Shaded circles\\nrepresent steps that may be repeated multiple times.\\nDetailed Workflow. The workflow can be described as follows. The end user initiates the in-\\nteraction by posing a question, such as “What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery\\n2?”, marked by\\n1 to the Commander agent. The Commander manages and coordinates with two\\nLLM-based assistant agents: the Writer and the Safeguard. Apart from directing the flow of commu-\\nnication, the Commander has the responsibility of handling memory tied to user interactions. This\\ncapability enables the Commander to capture and retain valuable context regarding the user’s ques-\\ntions and their corresponding responses. Such memory is subsequently shared across the system,\\nempowering the other agents with context from prior user interactions and ensuring more informed\\nand relevant responses.\\nIn this orchestrated process, the Writer, who combines the functions of a “Coder” and an “Inter-\\npreter” as defined in (Li et al., 2023a), will craft code and also interpret execution output logs. For in-\\nstance, during code writing (\\n2 and\\n3 ), the Writer may craft code “model.addConstr(x[‘supplier1’,\\n‘roastery2’] == 0, ‘prohibit’)” to add an additional constraint to answer the user’s question.\\nAfter receiving the code, the Commander will communicate with the Safeguard to screen the code\\nand ascertain its safety (\\n4 ); once the code obtains the Safeguard’s clearance, marked by\\n5 , the\\nCommander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code and request the Writer to\\ninterpret the execution results for the user’s question (\\n6 and\\n7 ). For instance, the writer may\\nsay “if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%.”\\nBringing this intricate process full circle, the Commander furnishes the user with the concluding\\nanswer (\\n8 ).\\nIf at a point there is an exception - either a security red flag raised by Safeguard (in\\n5 ) or code\\nexecution failures within Commander, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with\\nessential information in logs (\\n6 ). So, the process from\\n3 to\\n6 might be repeated multiple times,\\nuntil each user query receives a thorough and satisfactory resolution or until the timeout. This entire\\ncomplex workflow of multi-agent interaction is elegantly managed via AutoGen .\\nThe core workflow code for OptiGuide was reduced from over 430 lines to 100 lines using AutoGen ,\\nleading to significant productivity improvement. The new agents are customizable, conversable, and\\ncan autonomously manage their chat memories. This consolidation allows the coder and interpreter\\nroles to merge into a single “Writer” agent, resulting in a clean, concise, and intuitive implementation\\nthat is easier to maintain.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

If users lack access or expertise,\\nthe burden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time.\\nWe carried out a user study that juxtaposed OpenAI’s ChatGPT coupled with a Code Interpreter\\nagainst AutoGen -based OptiGuide. The study focused on a coffee supply chain scenario, and an\\nexpert Python programmer with proficiency in Gurobi participated in the test. We evaluated both\\nsystems based on 10 randomly selected questions, measuring time and accuracy. While both sys-\\ntems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide\\nbecause the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes\\nand 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approxi-\\nmately 2.5 minutes. In contrast, OptiGuide’s average problem-solving time was around 1.5 minutes,\\nmost of which was spent waiting for responses from the GPT-4 model. This indicates a 3x saving\\non the user’s time with AutoGen -based OptiGuide.\\nWhile using ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, users had to read through the code and instructions to\\nknow where to paste the code snippets. Additionally, running the code involves downloading it and\\nexecuting it in a terminal, a process that was both time-consuming and prone to errors. The response\\ntime from the Code Interpreter is also slower, as it generates lots of tokens to read the code, read the\\nvariables line-by-line, perform chains of thought analysis, and then produce the final answer code.\\nIn contrast, AutoGen integrates multiple agents to reduce user interactions by 3 - 5 times on average\\nas reported in Table 4, where we evaluated our system with 2000 questions across five OptiGuide\\napplications and measured how many prompts the user needs to type.\\nTable 4: Manual effort saved with OptiGuide (W/ GPT-4) while preserving the same coding perfor-\\nmance is shown in the data below.

ChatGPT+Code Interpreter is unable to run code with private pack-\\nages or customized dependencies (such as Gurobi); as a consequence, ChatGPT+Code Interpreter\\nrequires users to have engineering expertise and to manually handle multiple steps, disrupting the\\nworkflow and increasing the chance for mistakes. If customers lack access or expertise, the bur-\\nden falls on supporting engineers, increasing their on-call time.

This results in a 5x reduction in interaction and fundamentally changes the over-\\nall usability of the system. A stable workflow can be potentially reused for other applications or to\\ncompose a larger one.\\nTakeaways: The implementation of the multi-agent design with AutoGen in the OptiGuide appli-\\ncation offers several advantages. It simplifies the Python implementation and fosters a mixture of\\ncollaborative and adversarial problem-solving environments, with the Commander and Writer work-\\ning together while the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker.

Here,\\nthe board agent maintains the rules of the game and supports the players with information about the\\nboard. Players and the board agent all use natural language for communication.\\nIn Conversational Chess, each player is a AutoGen agent and can be powered either by a human or an\\nAI. A third party, known as the board agent, is designed to provide players with information about the\\nboard and ensure that players’ moves adhere to legal chess moves. Figure 14 illustrates the scenarios\\nsupported by Conversational Chess: AI/human vs. AI/human, and demonstrates how players and the\\nboard agent interact. This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves\\ncreatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games\\nmore entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational\\nchess).\\nTo realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options.\\nWhen human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human\\nplayer to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say\\n(such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the\\nmessage. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM\\nto parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then\\npushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error.\\nSubsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is\\nmade. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent.\\nAs shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When\\nthe player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message\\nfrom the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat\\nbetween one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps\\nkeep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.\\nThere are two notable benefits of using AutoGen to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the\\nagent design in AutoGen facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in\\nour chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat\\nmessages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly,\\nAutoGen greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition.

MiniWobChat consists of two agents: an assistant agent and an executor agent. The assistant\\nagent suggests actions to manipulate the browser while the executor executes the suggested actions\\nand returns rewards/feedback. The assistant agent records the feedback and continues until the feed-\\nback indicates task success or failure.\\nIn practice, many applications require the presence of agents capable of interacting with environ-\\nments and making decisions in an online context, such as in game playing (Mnih et al., 2013; Vinyals\\net al., 2017), web interactions (Liu et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017), and robot manipulations (Shen\\net al., 2021). With the multi-agent conversational framework in AutoGen , it becomes easy to de-\\ncompose the automatic agent-environment interactions and the development of a decision-making\\nagent by constructing an executor agent responsible for handling the interaction with the environ-\\nment, thereby delegating the decision-making part to other agents. Such a decomposition allows\\ndevelopers to reuse the decision-making agent for new tasks with minimal effort rather than build-\\ning a specialized decision-making agent for every new environment.\\nWorkflow. We demonstrate how to use AutoGen to build a working system for handling such\\nscenarios with the MiniWoB++ benchmark (Shi et al., 2017). MiniWoB++ comprises browser in-\\nteraction tasks that involve utilizing mouse and keyboard actions to interact with browsers. The\\nultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such\\nas “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires\\na sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at\\neach time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example\\nabove, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section.\\nWe designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using AutoGen , as shown in\\nFigure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in AssistantAgent and is responsible for\\nmaking action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized\\nUserProxyAgent , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions\\nsuggested by the AssistantAgent and returning feedback.\\nTo assess the performance of the developed working system, we compare it with RCI (Kim et al.,\\n2023), a recent solution for the MiniWoB++ benchmark that employs a set of self-critiquing prompts\\nand has achieved state-of-the-art performance. In our evaluation, we use all available tasks in the\\nofficial RCI code, with varying degrees of difficulty, to conduct a comprehensive analysis against\\nMiniWobChat. Figure 18 illustrates that MiniWobChat achieves competitive performance in this\\nevaluation8. Specifically, among the 49 available tasks, MiniWobChat achieves a success rate of\\n52.8%, which is only 3.6%lower than RCI, a method specifically designed for the MiniWob++\\nbenchmark. It is worth noting that in most tasks, the difference between the two methods is mirrored\\nas shown in Figure 18. If we consider 0.1 as a success rate tolerance for each task, i.e., two methods\\nthat differ within 0.1 are considered to have the same performance, both methods outperform the\\n8We report the results of RCI by running its official code with default settings.\\n32', metadata={'source': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",
