## üí° Why Developers Choose Azure AI Search?

Azure AI Search stands as the premier cloud AI search service, offering unparalleled relevance scoring and reranking capabilities. Leveraging Hybrid Search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) alongside state-of-the-art rerankers, it ensures your RAG application's search results are both comprehensive and contextually relevant, backed by SLA's. more [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-cognitive-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167).

- **Hybrid Search:** Combines the precision of keyword search with the contextual understanding of vector search, delivering highly relevant search results.
- **Semantic Reranking:** Employs advanced algorithms to refine search results, ensuring the most pertinent information tops your search queries.

## üìä Challenges in Data Indexing to Azure AI Search

Indexing data to Azure AI Search presents several challenges:

- **Integration with External Services**: While Azure AI Search offers robust native connectors with Azure landscape products, expanding integration capabilities with non-Azure services remains a focus area. This project will help you index your data from anywhere using crawl and pull strategies with flexibility for add-ons. For the latest on data connectors, visit [Azure's data source gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/EN-US/AZURE/search/search-data-sources-gallery).

- **Optimal Chunk Size Determination**: Identifying the ideal chunk size is critical and not easy. Oversized chunks may exceed the model's context window, while undersized ones might lack necessary context.

- **Advanced Content Processing for Sorting**: Achieving efficient retrieval hinges on the sorting strategy's ability to prioritize relevance. This requires sophisticated processing to understand the nuanced context within large datasets.

## üöÄ Approach

The primary goal of this project is to streamline and enhance the integration between various data sources and formats with the Azure AI Search Index. To achieve this, we've introduced a class named `AzureAIndexer`, located in the `src/indexers/ai_search_indexing.py` module. This class simplifies and optimizes the process of text chunking and data transformation, enabling faster iterations and better integrations. It also reduces overhead and addresses mentioned challenges in the process.

> ‚ùóLeveraging the best of LangChain and Azure SDKs, the `AzureAIndexer` class integrates Dependency Injection and the Factory Pattern to offer a flexible, extensible solution for advanced language processing and Azure AI Search integrations. Tailor it with custom logic to fit your unique data processing needs.

### Key Features of AzureAIndexer

- **Content Processing from Various Sources**: This feature provides the ability to parse and process content from a variety of sources and formats such as PDF, audio, API, text, and more. Using a crawl and push pattern, it allows for pulling data from multiple sources, processing the data, and indexing it in bulk.
- **Chunking Features**: This includes the ability to chunk files, which aids in organizing and structuring the data, ultimately boosting relevance. It offers flexibility to tailor chunk size and overlap, aligning with diverse text processing demands.
- **Out of the box Integration with Document Intelligence and other Azure AI services**: This feature enhances processing of complex documents by integrating with advanced OCR capabilities. It significantly improves the extraction and indexing of data from documents with complex layouts.
- **Seamless Indexing into Azure Search**: This feature enables efficient indexing of the processed and chunked files into an Azure Search index.

### üõ† Getting Started with `AzureAIndexer`

Initialize the `AzureAIndexer` class:

```python
# Import the AzureAIndexer class from the ai_search_indexing module
from src.indexers.ai_search_indexing import AzureAIndexer

DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "foundational-ada"
INDEX_NAME = "test-index-002"

# Create an instance of the AzureAIndexer class
azure_search_indexer_client = AzureAIndexer(
    index_name=INDEX_NAME, embedding_azure_deployment_name=DEPLOYMENT_NAME
)
```

Visit the `02-indexing-vectorized-content.ipynb` notebook to see the functionality mentioned above in action.
